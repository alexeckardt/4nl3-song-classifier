"Ah

Now I don't hardly know her

But I think I could love her

Crimson and clover

Ah

Well if she come walkin' over

Now I been waitin' to show her

Crimson and clover

Over and over



My mind's such a sweet thing

I wanna do everything

What a beautiful feeling

Crimson and clover

Over and over



Crimson and clover, over and over (repeat)"
"(It starts with one)
One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
(All I know)

Time is a valuable thing

Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings

Watch it count down to the end of the day

The clock ticks life away

(It's so unreal)

Didn't look out below

Watch the time go right out the window

Trying to hold on but didn't even know

I wasted it all just to watch you go



I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart

What it meant to be will eventually be a memory of a time when...



I tried so hard

And got so far

But in the end

It doesn't even matter

I had to fall

To lose it all

But in the end

It doesn't even matter



One thing, I don't know why

It doesn't even matter how hard you try

Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme

To remind myself how

I tried so hard

In spite of the way you were mocking me

Acting like I was part of your property

Remembering all the times you fought with me

I'm surprised it got so (far)

Things aren't the way they were before

You wouldn't even recognize me anymore

Not that you knew me back then

But it all comes back to me

In the end



You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart

What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when...



I tried so hard

And got so far

But in the end

It doesn't even matter

I had to fall

To lose it all

But in the end

It doesn't even matter



I've put my trust in you

Pushed as far as I can go

For all this

There's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you

Pushed as far as I can go

For all this

There's only one thing you should know



I tried so hard

And got so far

But in the end

It doesn't even matter

I had to fall

To lose it all

But in the end

It doesn't even matter"

"Now and then I think of when we were together

Like when you said you felt so happy you could die

Told myself that you were right for me

But felt so lonely in your company

But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness

Like resignation to the end

Always the end

So when we found that we could not make sense

Well you said that we would still be friends

But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over



But you didn't have to cut me off

Make out like it never happened

And that we were nothing

And I don't even need your love

But you treat me like a stranger

And that feels so rough

You didn't have to stoop so low

Have your friends collect your records

And then change your number

I guess that I don't need that though

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know



Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over

But had me believing it was always something that I'd done

And I don't wanna live that way

Reading into every word you say

You said that you could let it go

And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...



But you didn't have to cut me off

Make out like it never happened

And that we were nothing

And I don't even need your love

But you treat me like a stranger

And that feels so rough

You didn't have to stoop so low

Have your friends collect your records

And then change your number

I guess that I don't need that though

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Somebody

I used to know

"Nice to meet you

Where you been?

I could show you incredible things

Magic, madness, heaven, sins

Saw you there and I thought oh my god

Look at that face, you look like my next mistake

Love's a game, wanna play?

New money, suit and tie

I can read you like a magazine

Ain't it funny rumors fly

And I know you heard about me

So hey, let's be friends

I'm dying to see how this one ends

Grab your passport and my hand

I can make the bad guys good for a weekend



So it's gonna be forever

Or it's gonna go down in flames

You can tell me when it's over

If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers

They'll tell you I'm insane

Cause you know I love the players

And you love the game



Cause we're young and we're reckless

We'll take this way too far, It'll leave you breathless

Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers

They'll tell you I'm insane

But I've got a blank space baby

And I'll write your name



Cherry lips

Crystal skies

I could show you incredible things

Stolen kisses, pretty lies 

You're the king baby I'm your queen

Find out what you want

Be that girl for a month

Wait, the worst is yet to come

Oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms

I can make all the tables turn

Rose garden filled with thorns

Keep you second guessing like, oh my god

Who is she? I get drunk on jealousy

But you'll come back each time you leave

Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream



So it's gonna be forever

Or it's gonna go down in flames

You can tell me when it's over

If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers

They'll tell you I'm insane

Cause you know I love the players

And you love the game



Cause we're young and we're reckless

We'll take this way too far, It'll leave you breathless

Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers

They'll tell you I'm insane

But I've got a blank space baby

And I'll write your name



Boys only want love

If it's torture

Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn you

Boys only want love, If it's torture

Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn you



So it's gonna be forever

Or it's gonna go down in flames

"Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor

Reaching for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind???

For me it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now

Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now

And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now



Another shot of whiskey can't stop looking at the door

Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind???

For me it happens all the time



It's a quarter after one I'm a little drunk and I need you now

Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now

And I don't know how I can do without I just need you now



Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all



It's a quarter after one I'm all alone and I need you now

And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now

And I don't know how I can do without I just need you now

I just need you now

Oh baby I need you now"
"I'm holding on your rope

Got me ten feet off the ground

And I'm hearing what you say

But I just can't make a sound

You tell me that you need me

Then you go and cut me down

But wait...

You tell me that you're sorry

Didn't think I'd turn around and say..



That it's too late to apologize, it's too late

I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late



I'd take another chance, take a fall, take a shot for you

And I need you like a heart needs a beat

(But that's nothing new)

Yeah yeah



I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue

And you say

Sorry like the Angel Heaven let me think was you,

But I'm afraid



It's too late to apologize, it's too late

I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

Woahooo woah



It's too late to apologize, it's too late

I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

I said it's too late to apologize, yeah

"Help, I need somebody,

Help, not just anybody,

Help, you know I need someone, help.

When I was younger, so much younger than today,

I never needed anybody's help in any way.

But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured,

Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors.



Help me if you can, I'm feeling down

And I do appreciate you being round.

Help me, get my feet back on the ground,

Won't you please, please help me.



And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,

My independence seems to vanish in the haze.

But every now and then I feel so insecure,

I know that I just need you like I've never done before.

Every bond you break

Every step you take

You belong to me

How my poor heart aches

With every step you take



Every move you make

Every vow you break

Every smile you fake

Every claim you stake

I'll be watching you



Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace

I dream at night I can only see your face

I look around but it's you I can't replace

I feel so cold and I long for your embrace

I keep crying baby, baby please

"Almost heaven, West Virginia

Blue ridge mountains, Shenandoah river

Life is old there, older than the trees

Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze

Country roads, take me home

To the place I belong

West Virginia, mountain momma

Take me home, country roads



All my memories, gathered round her

Miner's lady, stranger to blue water

Dark and dusty, painted on the sky

Misty taste of moonshine, teardrops in my eyes



Country roads, take me home

To the place I belong

West Virginia, mountain momma

Take me home, country roads



I hear her voice in the mornin' hour she calls me

The radio reminds me of my home far away

And drivin' down the road I get a feeling

That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday



Country roads, take me home

To the place I belong

West Virginia, mountain momma

Take me home, country roads



Country roads, take me home

To the place I belong

West Virginia, mountain momma,

Take me home, country roads

Take me home, country roads

Take me home, country roads"

Dancin' alone every night while I live right above you?
I can hear your music playin'


I can feel your body swayin'



One floor below me you don't even know me



I love you







Oh, my darling 



Knock three times on the ceiling if you want me 



Twice on the pipe if the answer is no



Oh, my sweetness



Means you'll meet me in the hallway



Mmm, twice on the pipe means you ain't gonna show







If you look out your window tonight



Pull in the string with the note that's attached to my heart



Read how many times I saw you



How in my silence I adored you



And only in my dreams did that wall between us come apart







Oh, my darling 



Knock three times on the ceiling if you want me 



Twice on the pipe if the answer is no



Oh, my sweetness

"She's got a smile that it seems to me

Reminds me of childhood memories

Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky

Now and then when I see her face

She takes me away to that special place

And if I'd stare too long, I'd probably break down and cry



Oh, oh, oh

Sweet child o' mine

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Sweet love of mine



She's got eyes of the bluest skies

As if they thought of rain

I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain

Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place

Where as a child I'd hide

And pray for the thunder and the rain

To quietly pass me by



Oh, oh, oh

Sweet child o' mine

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Sweet love of mine



Oh, oh, oh, oh

Sweet child o' mine

Oh, oh, oh, oh

"Strolling along country roads with my baby

It starts to rain, it begins to pour

Without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin

I feel a shiver run up my spine

I feel the warmth of her hand in mine

Ooooo, I hear laughter in the rain

Walking hand in hand with the one I love

Ooooo, how I love the rainy days

And the happy way I feel inside



After a while we run under a tree

I turn to her and she kisses me

There with the beat of the rain on the leaves

Softly she breathes and I close my eyes

Sharing our love under stormy skies



Ooooo, I hear laughter in the rain

Walking hand in hand with the one I love

Ooooo, how I love the rainy days

And the happy way I feel inside

I feel the warmth of her hand in mine



[Musical Interlude]



I feel the warmth of her hand in mine

Ooooo, I hear laughter in the rain

Walking hand in hand with the one I love

Ooooo, how I love the rainy days

And the happy way I feel inside

Ooooh, I hear laughter in the rain

Walking hand in hand with the one I love

Ooooo, how I love the rainy days

And the happy way I feel inside"

"Sorry I never told you

All I wanted to say

And now it's too late to hold you

'Cause you've flown away

So far away

Never had I imagined

Living without your smile

Feeling and knowing you hear me

It keeps me alive

Alive 



And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven

Like so many friends we've lost along the way

And I know eventually we'll be together

One sweet day



Darling, I never showed you

Assumed you'd always be there

I took your presence for granted

But I always cared

And I miss the love we shared



And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven

Like so many friends we've lost along the way

And I know eventually we'll be together

One sweet day



Although the sun will never shine the same

I'll always look to a brighter day

Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep

You will always listen as I pray



And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven

Like so many friends we've lost along the way

And I know eventually we'll be together

One sweet day



And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven

Like so many friends we've lost along the way

And I know eventually we'll be together

One sweet day



Sorry I never told you

All I wanted to say"
"You can shake an apple off an apple tree

Shake-a, shake- sugar,

But you'll never shake me

Uh-uh-uh

No-sir-ee, uh, uh

I'm gonna stick like glue,

Stick because I'm

Stuck on you



Gonna run my fingers thru your long black hair

Squeeze you tighter than a grizzly bear

Uh-uh-uh,

Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh

I'm gonna stick like glue

Stick, because I'm

Stuck on you



Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall

Ain't gonna do you no good at all

'Cause once I catch ya and the kissin' starts

A team o' wild horses couldn't tear us apart



Try to take a tiger from his daddy's side

That's how love is gonna keep us tied

Uh-uh-uh

Yes-sir-ee, uh,uh

I'm gonna stick like glue

Stick, because I'm

Stuck on you"
"Something's got a hold of me lately

No, I don't know myself anymore

Feels like the walls are all closing in

And the devil's knocking at my door, whoa

Outta my mind, how many times

Did I tell you I'm no good at being alone?

Yeah it's taking a toll on me, trying my best to keep

From tearing the skin off my bones, don't you know



I lose control

When you're not next to me

I'm falling apart right in front of you

Can't you see?

I lose control

When you're not next to me

Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby

You make a mess of me



Problematic, problem is

I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit

Bad habit's hard to break when I'm with you

Yeah I know, I could do it on my own, but I want

That real full moon black magic and it takes two

Problematic, problem is

When I'm with you I'm an addict

And I need some release, my skin in your teeth

Can't see the forest through the trees

Got me down on my knees, darling please, oh



I lose control

When you're not next to me

I'm falling apart right in front of you

Can't you see?

I lose control

When you're not next to me

Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby

You make a mess of me, yeah



I lose control

When you're not here with me

I'm falling apart right in front of you

Can't you see?

I lose control

When you're not here with me

Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby

You make a mess of me"
"Never made it as a wise man

I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing

This is how you remind me

scream \""are we having fun yet?\""



yet, yet, yet, no, no

yet, yet, yet, no, no



it's not like you didn't know that

I said I love you and I swear I still do

"There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, 
it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go head and sell me out 
and I'll lay your shit bare



See how I leave with every piece of you

Don't underestimate the things that I will do



There's a fire starting in my heart

Reaching a fever pitch

And its bring me out the dark



The scars of your love remind me of us

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

The scars of your love they leave me breathless

I can't help feeling

We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it

To the beat



Baby I have no story to be told

But I've heard one of you

And I'm gonna make your head burn

Think of me in the depths of your despair

Making a home down there

It Reminds you of the home we shared



The scars of your love remind me of us

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

The scars of your love they leave me breathless

I can't help feeling

We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it

To the beat



We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it

To the beat



Throw your soul through every open door

Count your blessings to find what you look for

Turned my sorrow into treasured gold

You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow



We could have had it all

We could have had it all

It all, it all it all,

We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it

To the beat



We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it, you played it, you played it

To the beat"
"I remember when rock was young

Me and Suzie had so much fun

holding hands and skimming stones

Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own

But the biggest kick I ever got

was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock

While the other kids were Rocking Round the Clock

we were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock



Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking

when your feet just can't keep still

I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will

Oh Lawdy mama those Friday nights

when Suzie wore her dresses tight

and the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight



But the years went by and the rock just died

Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy

Long nights crying by the record machine

dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans

But they'll never kill the thrills we've got

burning up to the Crocodile Rock

Learning fast as the weeks went past

we really thought the Crocodile Rock would last



Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking

when your feet just can't keep still

I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will

Oh Lawdy mama those Friday nights

when Suzie wore her dresses tight

and the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight



I remember when rock was young

Me and Suzie had so much fun

holding hands and skimming stones

Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own

"I found a love for me

Darling, just dive right in, follow my lead

Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet

Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love

Not knowing what it was

I will not give you up this time

But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own

And in your eyes you're holding mine



Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms

Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song

When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath

But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight



Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know

She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home

I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets

To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love

Fighting against all odds

I know we'll be alright this time

Darling, just hold my hand

Be my girl, I'll be your man

I see my future in your eyes



Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms

Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song

When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful

I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight



Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms

Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song

I have faith in what I see

Now I know I have met an angel in person

And she looks perfect

I don't deserve this

You look perfect tonight"

"I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind

There was something so pleasant about that place.

Even your emotions had an echo

In so much space

And when you're out there

Without care,

Yeah, I was out of touch

But it wasn't because I didn't know enough

I just knew too much



Does that make me crazy?

Does that make me crazy?

Does that make me crazy?

Possibly [radio version]

probably [album version]



And I hope that you are having the time of your life

But think twice, that's my only advice



Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are,

Ha ha ha bless your soul

You really think you're in control



Well, I think you're crazy

I think you're crazy

I think you're crazy

Just like me



My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb

And all I remember is thinking, I want to be like them

Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun

And it's no coincidence I've come

And I can die when I'm done



Maybe I'm crazy

Maybe you're crazy

Maybe we're crazy

Girl, we couldn't get much higher

Come on baby, light my fire

Come on baby, light my fire

Try to set the night on fire



The time to hesitate is through

No time to wallow in the mire

Try now we can only lose

And our love become a funeral pyre



Come on baby, light my fire

Come on baby, light my fire

Try to set the night on fire, yeah



The time to hesitate is through

No time to wallow in the mire

Try now we can only lose

And our love become a funeral pyre



Come on baby, light my fire

Come on baby, light my fire

Try to set the night on fire



You know that it would be untrue

You know that I would be a liar

If I was to say to you

Girl, we couldn't get much higher



Come on baby, light my fire

Come on baby, light my fire

Try to set the night on fire



Try to set the night on fire

Try to set the night on fire

Try to set the night on fire"
"Well, I love a rainy night

I love a rainy night

I love to hear the thunder

Watch the lightning

When it lights up the sky

You know it makes me feel good



Well, I love a rainy night

It's such a beautiful sight

I love to feel the rain

On my face

Taste the rain on my lips

In the moonlight shadow



Showers washed

All my cares away

I wake up to a sunny day

'Cos I love a rainy night

Yeah, I love a rainy night

Well, I love a rainy night

Well, I love a rainy night



Ooh-ooh



I love a rainy night

I love a rainy night

I love to hear the thunder

Watch the lightning

When it lights up the sky

You know it makes me feel good



Well, I love a rainy night

It's such a beautiful sight

I love to feel the rain

On my face

To taste the rain on my lips

In the moonlight shadows



Puts a song

In this heart of mine

Puts a smile on my face every time



'Cos I love a rainy night

Yeah, I love a rainy night

Ooh, I love a rainy night

Yeah, I love a rainy night



Ooh-ooh



[Instrumental Interlude]



Showers washed

All my cares away

I wake up to a sunny day

'Cos I love a rainy night

Yeah, I love a rainy night

Well, I love a rainy night

I love a rainy night

Well, I love a rainy night

You can see it in my eyes

Yeah, I love a rainy night

Well, it makes me high

Ooh, I love a rainy night

You know I do, yeah, yeah

I love a rainy night



I love a rainy night

You can see it in my eyes."
"Who can take a sunrise 
Sprinkle it with dew 
Cover it in chocolate and a miracle or two 
The Candy Man 
The Candy Man can 
The Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good 

Who can take a rainbow 

Wrap it in a sigh 

Soak it in the sun and make strawberry-lemon pie 

The Candy Man 

The Candy Man can 

The Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good 

Willy Wonka makes everything he bakes 

Satisfying and delicious 

Talk about your childhood wishes 

You can even eat the dishes 

Who can take tomorrow 

Dip it in a dream 

Separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream 

The Candy Man 

The Candy Man can 

The Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good 

And the world tastes good 'cause the Candy Man thinks it should..."
"I'm saying all the things that I know you'll like

Making good conversation

I gotta handle you just right

You know what I mean

I took you to an intimate restaurant

Then to a suggestive movie

There's nothing left to talk about

Unless it's horizontally



Let's get physical, physical

I wanna get physical

Let's get into physical

Let me hear your body talk, your body talk

Let me hear your body talk



I've been patient, I've been good

Tried to keep my hands on the table

It's gettin' hard this holdin' back

If you know what I mean



I'm sure you'll understand my point of view

We know each other mentally

You gotta know that you're bringin' out

The animal in me



Let's get physical, physical

I wanna get physical

Let's get into physical

Let me hear your body talk, your body talk

Let me hear your body talk



Let's get physical, physical

I wanna get physical

Let's get into physical

Let me hear your body talk, your body talk

Let me hear your body talk



Let's get physical, physical

I wanna get physical

Let's get into physical

Let me hear your body talk, your body talk

Let me hear your body talk



Let's get animal, animal

I wanna get animal

Let's get into animal

Let me hear your body talk

Let me hear your body talk"
"Swaying room as the music starts

Strangers making the most of the dark

Two by two their bodies become one

I see you through the smokey air

Can't you feel the weight of my stare

You're so close but still a world away

What I'm dying to say, is that



Chorus:



I'm crazy for you

Touch me once and you'll know it's true

I never wanted anyone like this

It's all brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss

I'm crazy for you, crazy for you



Trying hard to control my heart

I walk over to where you are

Eye to eye we need no words at all



Slowly now we begin to move

Every breath I'm deeper into you

Soon we two are standing still in time

If you read my mind, you'll see



(chorus)



It's all brand new, I'm crazy for you

And you know it's true

I'm crazy, crazy for you"
"There's another world inside of me 
That you may never see 
There're secrets in this life 
That I can't hide 
Somewhere in this darkness 
There's a light that I can't find 

Maybe it's too far away... 

Maybe I'm just blind... 



Maybe I'm just blind... 



[chorus] 

So hold me when I'm here 

Right me when I'm wrong 

Hold me when I'm scared 

And love me when I'm gone 

Everything I am 

And everything in me 

Wants to be the one 

You wanted me to be 

I'll never let you down 

Even if I could 

I'd give up everything 

If only for your good 

So hold me when I'm here 

Right me when I'm wrong 

You can hold me when I'm scared 

You won't always be there 

So love me when I'm gone 

[end chorus] 



Love me when I'm gone... 



When your education x-ray 

Can not see under my skin 

I won't tell you a damn thing 

That I could not tell my friends 

Roaming through this darkness 

I'm alive but I'm alone 

Part of me is fighting this 

But part of me is gone 



[chorus] 



Maybe I'm just blind... 



[chorus] 



Love me when I'm gone... 



Love me when I'm gone 

When I'm Gone 

When I'm Gone 

When I'm Gone"
"As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left 
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long, that 
Even my mama thinks that my mind is gone 
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it 
Me be treated like a punk you know that's unheard of 

You better watch how you're talking, and where you're walking 

Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk 

I really hate to trip but i gotta loc 

As I Grow I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool 

I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like 

on my knees in the night, saying prayers in the streetlight. 

Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Keep spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Keep spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 



The getto situation, they got me facin' 

I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the stripes 

So I gotta be down with the hood team 

Too much television watching got me chasing dreams 

I'm an educated fool with money on my mind 

Got my tin in my hand and a gleam in my eye 

I'm a loc'd out gangsta set trippin' banger 

And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger, fool 

Death ain't nothing but a heartbeat away, 

I'm living life, do or die, what can I say 

I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24 

The way things are going I don't know 



Tell me why are we, so blind to see 

That the one's we hurt, are you and me 

Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Power and the money, money and the power 

Minute after minute, hour after hour 

Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking 

What's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin' 

They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me 

If they can't undersstand it, how can they reach me 

I guess they can't, I guess they won't 

I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool 



Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Tell me why are we, so blind to see 

That the one's we hurt, are you and me 

Tell me why are we, so blind to see 

That the one's we hurt, are you and me

The angels got together

And decided to create a dream come true

So they sprinkled moondust in your hair of gold

And starlight in your eyes of blue

"Welcome to your life 
There's no turning back 
Even while we sleep 
We will find you 
Acting on your best behaviour 
Turn your back on mother nature 

Everybody wants to rule the world 



It's my own design 

It's my own remorse 

Help me to decide 

Help me make the most 

Of freedom and of pleasure 

Nothing ever lasts forever 

Everybody wants to rule the world



There's a room where the light won't find you 

Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down 

When they do I'll be right behind you 



So glad we've almost made it 

So sad they had to fade it 

Everybody wants to rule the world



I can't stand this indecision 

Married with a lack of vision 

Everybody wants to rule the world

Say that you'll never never never never need it 

One headline why believe it? 

Everybody wants to rule the world



All for freedom and for pleasure 

Nothing ever lasts for ever 

Everybody wants to rule the world"
"And I never thought I'd feel this way

And as far as I'm concerned

I'm glad I got the chance to say

That I do believe I love you

And if I should ever go away

Well, then close your eyes and try to feel

The way we do today

And then if you can remember



Keep smilin', keep shinin'

Knowin' you can always count on me, for sure

That's what friends are for

For good times and bad times

I'll be on your side forever more

That's what friends are for



Well, you came and opened me

And now there's so much more I see

And so by the way I thank you



Whoa, and then for the times when we're apart

Well, then close your eyes and know

These words are comin' from my heart

And then if you can remember, oh



Keep smiling, keep shining

Knowing you can always count on me, for sure

That's what friends are for

In good times, in bad times

I'll be on your side forever more

Oh, that's what friends are for



Whoa...oh...oh...keep smilin', keep shinin'

Knowin' you can always count on me, for sure

That's what friends are for

For good times and bad times

I'll be on your side forever more

That's what friends are for



Keep smilin', keep shinin'

Knowin' you can always count on me, oh, for sure

'Cause I tell you that's what friends are for

For good times and for bad times

[Eve]

Uh, uh, uh, huh

Yo, yo

Drop your glasses, shake your asses

Face screwed up like you having hot flashes

Which one, pick one, this one, classic

Red from blonde, yeah bitch I'm drastic

Why this, why that, lips stop askin

Listen to me baby, relax and start passin

Expressway, hair back, weavin through the traffic

This one strong should be labeled as a hazard

Some of y'all niggas hot, sike I'm gassin

Clowns I spot em and I can't stop laughin

Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin

Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic

Some of y'all aint writin well, too concerned with fashion

None of you aint gizell, cat walk and imagine

Alotta y'all Hollywood, drama, passed it

Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it



[CHORUS: Gwen Stefani]

And if I had to give you up

It's only been a year

Now I got my foot through the door

And I aint goin nowhere

It took awhile to get me in

And I'm gonna take my time

Don't fight that good shit in your ear

Now let me blow ya mind



[Eve]

They wanna bank up, crank up, makes me dizzy(?)

Shank up, haters wanna come after me

You aint a ganster, prankster, too much to eat

Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me



Now while you grittin your teeth

Frustration baby you gotta breathe

Take alot more that you to get rid of me

You see I do what they can't do, I just do me

Aint no stress when it comes to stage, get what you see

Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe

Huh, sixteens mine, create my own lines

Love for my wordplay that's hard to find

Sophomore, I aint scared, one of a kind

All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine

Eyes bloodshot, stressin, chills up your spine

Huh, sick to your stomach wishin I wrote your lines



[CHORUS]



[Eve]

Let your bones crack

Your back pop, I can't stop

Excitement, glock shots from your stash box

Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route

Locked down, blastin, sets while I mash out

Yeah nigga, mash out, D-R-E

Back track, think back, E-V-E

Do you like that (ooooh), you got to I know you

Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too

Don't believe I'll show you, take you with me

Turn you on, pension gone, give you relief

Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me

'Dancin much, get it all? now I'm complete, uh huh

Still stallion, brick house, pile it on

Ryde or Die, bitch, double R, can't crawl

Beware, cuz I crush anything I land on

Me here, aint no mistake nigga it was planned on

The lights down low

Just one more dance

"I didn't mean it
When I said I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight
I never should've let you go
I didn't know nothing
I was stupid

I was foolish

I was lying to myself

I couldn't have fathomed that I would ever

Be without your love

Never imagined I'd be

Sitting here beside myself



'Cause I didn't know you

'Cause I didn't know me

But I thought I knew everything

I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling

Now that I don't

Hear your voice

Or have your touch and kiss your lips

Cause I don't have a choice

Oh, what I wouldn't give

To have you lying by my side

Right here, 'cause baby



When you left

I lost a part of me

It's still so hard to believe

Come back baby please, 'cause

We belong together

Who else am I gonna lean on

When times get rough

Who's gonna talk to me on the phone

Till the sun comes up

Who's gonna take your place

There ain't nobody better

Oh baby, baby

We belong together



I can't sleep at night

When you are on my mind

Bobby Womack's on the radio

Singing to me

'If you think you're lonely now'

Wait a minute

This is too deep, too deep

I gotta change the station

So I turn the dial

Trying to catch a break

And then I hear Babyface

I only think of you

And it's breaking my heart

I'm trying to keep it together

But I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element

I'm throwing things

Crying

Trying to figure out

Where the hell I went wrong

The pain reflected in this song

Ain't even half of what

I'm feeling inside

I need you

Need you back in my life baby



When you left

I lost a part of me

It's still so hard to believe

Come back baby please, 'cause

We belong together

Who else am I gonna lean on

When times get rough

Who's gonna talk to me on the phone

Till the sun comes up

Who's gonna take your place

There ain't nobody better

Oh baby, baby

We belong together



When you left

I lost a part of me

It's still so hard to believe

Come back baby please, 'cause

We belong together

Who am I gonna lean on

When times get rough

Who's gonna talk to me

Till the sun comes up

Who's gonna take your place

There ain't nobody better

Oh baby, baby

We belong together"
"You got me looking at that heaven in your eyes

I was chasing your direction, I was telling you no lies

And I was loving you when the words are said,

Baby, I lose my head

And in a world of people, there's only you and I

There ain't nothing come between us in the end

How can I hold you when you ain't even mine?

Only you can see me through, I leave it up to you



Do it light, taking me through the night

Shadow dancing, baby you do it right

Give me more, drag me across the floor

Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more



All that I need is just one moment in your arms

I was chasing your affection, I was doing you no harm

And I was loving you, make it shine, make it rain,

Baby, I know my way

I need that sweet sensation of living in your love

I can't breath when you're away, it pulls me down

You are the question and the answer am I

Only you can see me through, I leave it up to you



CHORUS



And in this world of people, there's only you and I

There ain't nothing come between us in the end

Ah, can I hold you when you ain't even mine?

Only you can see me through, I leave it up to you



CHORUS"
"Right from the start

You were a thief

You stole my heart

And I’m your willing victim

I let you see the parts of me

That weren't all that pretty

And with every touch you fixed them

Now you've been talking in your sleep oh oh

Things you never say to me oh oh

Tell me that you've had enough

Of our love, our love

It's been written in the scars on our hearts

We're not broken just bent

And we can learn to love again



I'm sorry I don't understand

Where all of this is coming from

I thought that we were fine

Your head is running wild again

My dear we still have everythin'

And it's all in your mind

You're holding it in

You're pouring a drink

No nothing is as bad as it seems

We'll come clean

Just a little bit's enough

Just a second we're not broken just bent

Oh oh, that we're not broken just bent

And we can learn to love again"
"Easy come, easy go
That's just how you live, oh
Take take take it all
But you never give
Should've known you was trouble
From the first kiss

Had your eyes wide open

Why were they open?



Gave you all I had

And you tossed it in the trash

You tossed it in the trash, you did

To give me all your love

Is all I ever asked

Throw my hand on the blade for ya

In the hood then the ladies saying \""50 you hot\""



They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac

But holla in New York them niggas'll tell ya im loco

And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold

"Got a girl from the south side, got braids in her hair

First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell off my chair

Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks

Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed

I know every curve like the back of my hand

Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry

I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can



The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt

But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help

Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet

It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets



Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed

I know every curve like the back of my hand

Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry

I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can



We're out here in the boondocks

With the breeze and the birds

Tangled up in the tall grass

With my lips on hers

On the highway to heaven

Headed south of her smile

Get there when we get there

Every inch is a mile



Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed

I know every curve like the back of my hand

Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry

I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can



I'ma take it slow

As fast as I can

Body like a back road

Drivin' with my eyes closed

I know every curve like the back of my hand"
"Everybody needs a little time away

I heard her say, from each other

Even lovers need a holiday

Far away from each other

Hold me now

It's hard for me to say I'm sorry

I just want you to stay



After all that we've been through

I will make it up to you

I promise to

And after all that's been said and done

You're just a part of me I can't let go



Couldn't stand to be kept away

Just for the day, from your body

Wouldn't want to be swept away

Far away from the one that I love



Hold me now

It's hard for me to say I'm sorry

I just want you to know

Hold me now

I really want to tell you I'm sorry

I could never let you go



After all that we've been through

I will make it up to you

I promise to

And after all that's been said and done

You're just a part of me I can't let go

And after all that we've been through

I will make it up to you

I promise to...You're gonna be the lucky one"

"Your love is liftin' me higher

Than I've ever been lifted before

Your love is liftin' me higher

Than I've ever been lifted before

So Keep it up, quench my desire

And I'll be at your side forever more

Now once, I was downhearted

Disappointment was my closest friend

But you came, he soon departed

And he never showed his face again



[Instrumental Interlude]



Oooooh, I'm so glad I finally found you

Your that one in a million man

When you wrap your lovin' arms around me

I can stand up and face the world again



Your love is liftin' me highter

Than I've ever been lifted before

So keep it up, quench my desire

And I'll be at your side forever more [3x]"
"Time can never mend the careless whispers, of a good friend

To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind

There's no comfort in the truth 
Pain is all you'll find

Should've known better



I feel so unsure

As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor

As the music dies, something in your eyes

Calls to mind the silver screen

And all its sad good-byes



I'm never gonna dance again

Guilty feet have got no rhythm

Though it's easy to pretend

I know your not a fool



Should've known better than to cheat a friend

And waste the chance that I've been given

So I'm never gonna dance again

The way I danced with you



Time can never mend

The careless whispers of a good friend

To the heart and mind

Ignorance is kind

There's no comfort in the truth

Pain is all you'll find



I'm never gonna dance again

Guilty feet have got no rhythm

Though it's easy to pretend

I know your not a fool



Should've known better than to cheat a friend

And waste this chance that I've been given

So I'm never gonna dance again

The way I danced with you



Never without your love



Tonight the music seems so loud

I wish that we could lose this crowd

Maybe it's better this way

We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say



We could have been so good together

We could have lived this dance forever

But no one's gonna dance with me

Please stay



And I'm never gonna dance again

Guilty feet have got no rhythm 

Though it's easy to pretend

I know your not a fool



Should've known better than to cheat a friend

And waste the chance that I've been given

So I'm never gonna dance again

The way I danced with you



(Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone

(Now that you're gone) What I did's so wrong

That you had to leave me alone"
"Yeah, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael

Stars on the boulevard

"It's gettin' near dawn,

When lights close their tired eyes.

I'll soon be with you my love,

To give you my dawn surprise.

I'll be with you darling soon,

I'll be with you when the stars start falling.



I've been waiting so long

To be where I'm going

In the sunshine of your love.



I'm with you my love,

The light's shinin' through on you.

Yes, I'm with you my love,

It's the morning and just we two.

"She calls out to the man on the street

\""Sir, can you help me?

It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep

Is there somewhere you can tell me?\""

He walks on, doesn't look back

He pretends he can't hear her

Starts to whistle as he crosses the street

Seems embarrassed to be there



Oh think twice, 'cause it's another day for

You and me in paradise

Oh think twice, 'cause it's another day for you

You and me in paradise



Just think about it



She calls out to the man on the street

He can see she's been crying

She's got blisters on the soles of her feet

She can't walk but she's trying



Oh think twice, 'cause it's another day for

You and me in paradise

Oh think twice, it's just another day for you

You and me in paradise



Just think about it



Oh lord, is there nothing more anybody can do

Oh lord, there must be something you can say



You can tell from the lines on her face

You can see that she's been there

Probably been moved on from every place

'Cos she didn't fit in there



Oh think twice, 'cause it's another day for

You and me in paradise

Oh think twice, it's just another day for you

You and me in paradise

watching the tide go out,
so all alone and blue,

I watched your ship,
as it sailed out to sea,
Why oh why,
must I go on like this?

and taking all of me.
I just be alonely stranger on the shore?
The sighing of waves,
the wailing of the wing.
The tears in my eyes burn,
pleading \""My love, return\""."

That would soar a thousand feet high,

What, what can I give you in return?

But I, would rather you let me give my heart,

To Sir, with Love"
"(Carter/Lewis)

Every time I see you lookin' my way

Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?

In the car or walking down the highway

Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?



When you move up closer to me

I get a feelin' that's ooo-wee

Can't you hear the poundin' of my heartbeat

'cause you're the one I love, you're the one I love



When I feel you put your arms around me

Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?

Then I'm glad, I'm mighty glad I found you

Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?



When you asked me to meet your Ma

I knew that baby, we'd be going far

Can't you hear the poundin' of my heartbeat?

'cause you're the one I love, you're the one I love



[Rhythm guitar]



All my friends are cryin' out to meet you

Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?

Now's the time to go and see the preacher

Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?



Wedding bells are gonna chime

Baby, baby, you're gonna be mine

Can't you hear the poundin' of my heartbeat

'cause you're the one I love, you're the one I love



Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?

Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?

Baby, baby, can't you hear my heartbeat?"
"Yeah... 
Uh huh 
So seductive 
I'll take you to the candy shop 
I'll let you lick the lollypop 

Go 'head girl, don't you stop 

Keep going 'til you hit the spot (woah) 



I'll take you to the candy shop 

Boy one taste of what I got 

I'll have you spending all you got 

Keep going 'til you hit the spot (woah) 



You can have it your way, how do you want it 

You gon' back that thing up or should i push up on it 

Temperature rising, okay lets go to the next level 

Dance floor jam packed, hot as a teakettle 

I'll break it down for you now, baby it's simple 



If you be a nympho, I'll be a nympho 

In the hotel or in the back of the rental 

On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into 

Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor 

Have your friends teasin you 'bout how sprung I gotcha 

Wanna show me how you work it baby, no problem 



Get on top then get to bouncing round like a low rider 

I'm a seasons vet when it come to this shit 

After you work up a sweat you can play with the stick 

I'm tryin to explain baby the best way I can 

I melt in your mouth girl, not in your hands (ha ha) 



I'll take you to the candy shop 

I'll let you lick the lollypop 

Go 'head girl, don't you stop

Keep going 'til you hit the spot (woah) 



Girl what we do (what we do) 

And where we do (and where we do) 

The things we do (things we do) 

Are just between me and you (oh yeah) 



Give it to me baby, nice and slow 

Climb on top, ride like you in the rodeo 

You ain't never heard a sound like this before 

Cause I ain't never put it down like this 

Soon as I come through the door she get to pullin on my zipper 



It's like it's a race who can get undressed quicker 

Isn't it ironic how erotic it is to watch em in thongs 

Had me thinking 'bout that ass after I'm gone 

I touch the right spot at the right time 

Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind 

So seductive, you should see the way she wind 



Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind 

As Long as she ain't stoppin, homie I aint stoppin 

Drippin wet with sweat man its on and popping 

All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle its on 

And we gon' sip til every bubble in every bottle is gone 



I'll take you to the candy shop 

I'll let you lick the lollypop 

Go 'head girl, don't you stop 

Keep going 'til you hit the spot (woah) 



I'll take you to the candy shop 

Boy one taste of what I got 

I'll have you spending all you got 

Keep going 'til you hit the spot (woah)"
"You spin my head right round, right round

(You spin my head right round, right round

When you go down, when you go down down)

Hey, walk out of the house with my swagger

Hop in, there we go, I got places to go

People to see, time is precious

I look at my Cartier, they outta control

Just like my mind where I'm goin

No women, no shorties, no nothin but clothes

No stoppin now, my Pirellis on roll

I like my jewelry that's always on gold



I know the storm is comin

My pockets keep tellin me it's gonna shower

Call up my homies that's home

Then pop in the night cause it's meant to be ours

We keep a fadeaway shot

Cause we be ballin, it's platinum Patron that be ours

Lil mama, I owe you just like the flowers

Girl you the truth with all of that goody power cause



You spin my head right round, right round

When you go down, when you go down down

(You spin my head right round, right round

When you go down, when you go down down)



From the top of the pole I watch her go down

She got me throwing my money around

Ain't nothing more beautiful to be found

...it's going down down!



From the top of the pole I watch her go down

Heeeey! Shawty must know I'm the man

My money love her like a number one fan

Don't open my mouth, let her talk to my bands

My Benjamin Frank-a-lans

A couple of grands, I got rubberbands

My paper planes making her dance

Get dirty all night, that's part of my plan

We building castles that's made out of sand



She's amazing, her fire blazing

Hotter than cajun; girl won't you move a lil' closer?

Time to get paid, it's maximum wage

That body belongs on a poster

I'm in a daze, that bottom is waving at me, like dammit I know ya

Doing a show like a gun out of holster

Tell me whatever then I'll be your chauffeur cause...

Yeeeah! I'm spending my money

I'm outta control

Somebody help me

She's taking my bank roll

But I'm king of the club

And I'm wearing the crown

Popping these bottles, touching these models

Watching they asses go

Down down down



You spin my head right round, right round

When you go down, when you go down down

(You spin my head right round, right round

When you go down, when you go down down)"

Aint got no money in my pocket, but Im already here

Boys trying to touch my junk, junk 

Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk

"For all the times that you rained on my parade

And all the clubs you get in using my name

You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake!

You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song

'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

I don't but, you still hit my phone up

And baby I'll be movin' on

And I think it should be somethin'

That I don't wanna hold back

Maybe you should know that



My mama don't like you and she likes everyone

And I never like to admit that I was wrong

And I've been so caught up in my job,

Didn't see what's going on

But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself



But when you told me that you hated my friends

The only problem was with you and not them

And every time you told me my opinion was wrong

And tried to make me forget where I came from



And I didn't wanna write a song

'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

I don't but, you still hit my phone up

And baby I'll be movin' on

And I think it should be somethin'

That I don't wanna hold back

Maybe you should know that



My mama don't like you and she likes everyone

And I never like to admit that I was wrong

And I've been so caught up in my job

Didn't see what's going on

And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself



For all the times that you made me feel small

I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all

I never felt so low when I was vulnerable

Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself"
"You're the reason I'm living
You're the breath that I take
You're the stars in my heaven
You're the sun when I wake
You're the reason I'm living
Oh you carry me through
All of life's little burdens
I'd be lost without you
A long long time ago
When I was down
Wo-o-o you picked me up
And showed me true love
Still could be found
You're the reason I do things
You're the things that I do
You're the reason I'm livin
I'd be lost without you
Come and tell me again
You're the reason I'm living
Oh you carry me through
All of life's little burdens
I'd be lost without you"
"Spending all my nights, 
All my money going out on the town

Doing anything just to get you off of my mind

But when the morning comes,

I'm right back where I started again

Trying to forget you is just a waste of time



Baby come back, any kind of fool could see

There was something in everything about you

Baby come back, you can blame it all on me

I was wrong, and I just can't live without you



All day long, wearing a mask of false bravado

Trying to keep up the smile that hides a tear

But as the sun goes down, I get that empty feeling again

How I wish to God that you were here



Baby come back, any kind of fool could see

There was something in everything about you

Baby come back, you can blame it all on me

I was wrong, and I just can't live without you



Now that I put it all together

Give me the chance to make you see

Have you used up all the love in your heart

Nothing left for me, ain't there nothing left for me



Baby come back, any kind of fool could see

There was something in everything about you

Baby come back, you can blame it all on me

I was wrong, and I just can't live without you



I was wrong, and I just can't live"
"Shot like an arrow going through my heart

That's the pain I feel

I feel whenever we're apart

Not to say that I'm in love with you

But who's to say that I'm not

I just know that it feels wrong,

When I'm away too long

It makes my body hot

So let me tell ya baby 



I'll tell your mama

I'll tell your friends

I'll tell anyone whose heart can comprehend

Send it in a letter baby

Tell you on the phone

I'm not the kinda girl

Who likes to be alone

I miss ya much (boy-oh-I miss you much)

I really miss you much (M-I-S-S you much)

I miss ya much (boy-oh-I miss you much)

Baby I really miss you much (M-I-S-S you much) 



I'm rushing home

Just as soon as I can

I'm rushing home to see

Your smiling face

And feel your warm embrace

It makes f-feel so g-g-g good

So I'll tell you baby 



I'll tell your mama

I'll tell your friends

I'll tell anyone whose heart can comprehend

Send it in a letter baby

Tell you on the phone

"Woah!

Bad, Bad Leroy Brown

Well the south side of Chicago

Is the baddest part of town

And if you go down there

You better just beware

Of a man name of Leroy Brown



Now Leroy more than trouble

You see he stand bout six foot four

All those downtown ladies call him \""Treetop Lover\""

All the men just call him \""Sir\""



And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown

The baddest man in the whole damn town

Badder than old King Kong

And meaner than a junkyard dog



Now Leroy he a gambler

And he like his fancy clothes

And he like to wave his diamond rings

Under everybody's nose



He got a custom Continental

He got an Eldorado too

He got a 32 gun in his pocket full a fun

He got a razor in his shoe



And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown

The baddest man in the whole damn town

Badder than old King Kong

And meaner than a junkyard dog



Well Friday 'bout a week ago

Leroy shootin' dice

And at the edge of the bar

Sat a girl named Doris

And oh that girl looked nice



Well he cast his eyes upon her

And the trouble soon began

And Leroy Brown had learned a lesson

'Bout a-messin' with the wife of a jealous man



And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown

The baddest man in the whole damn town

Badder than a-old King Kong

And meaner than a junkyard dog



Well the two men took to fighting

And when they pulled them from the floor

Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle

With a couple of pieces gone



And it's bad, bad Leroy Brown

The baddest man in the whole damn town

Badder than old King Kong

And meaner than a junkyard dog



And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown

The baddest man in the whole damn town

Badder than old King Kong

And meaner than a junkyard dog



Yeah he was badder than old King Kong

And meaner than a junkyard dog."
