"Saying I love you

Is not the words I want to hear from you

It's not that I want you

Not to say, but if you only knew

How easy it would be to show me how you feel

More than words is all you have to do to make it real

Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me

Cos I'd already know



What would you do if my heart was torn in two

More than words to show you feel

That your love for me is real

What would you say if I took those words away

Then you couldn't make things new

Just by saying I love you



More than words



Now I've tried to talk to you and make you understand

All you have to do is close your eyes

And just reach out your hands and touch me

Hold me close don't ever let me go

More than words is all I ever needed you to show

Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me

Cos I'd already know



What would you do if my heart was torn in two

More than words to show you feel

That your love for me is real

What would you say if I took those words away

Then you couldn't make things new

Just by saying I love you



More than words"
"You got a fast car

And I want a ticket to anywhere

Maybe we make a deal

Maybe together we can get somewhere

Any place is better

Starting from zero, got nothing to lose

Maybe we'll make something

Me, myself, I got nothing to prove



You got a fast car

And I got a plan to get us out of here

I've been working at the convenience store

Managed to save just a little bit of money

Won't have to drive too far

Just across the border and into the city

And you and I can both get jobs

Finally see what it means to be living



See, my old man's got a problem

He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is

He said his body's too old for working

His body's too young to look like his

So Mama went off and left him

She wanted more from life than he could give

I said, somebody's got to take care of him

So I quit school and that's what I did



You got a fast car

Is it fast enough so we can fly away?

Still gotta make a decision

Leave tonight or live and die this way



So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car

Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk

City lights lay out before us

And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder

And I-I, had a feeling that I belonged

I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone



You got a fast car

We go cruising to entertain ourselves

You still ain't got a job

So I work in the market as a checkout girl

I know things will get better

You'll find work and I'll get promoted

And we'll move out of the shelter

Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs



So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car

Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk

City lights lay out before us

And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder

And I-I, had a feeling that I belonged

I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone



You got a fast car

I got a job that pays all our bills

You stay out drinking late at the bar

See more of your friends than you do of your kids

I'd always hoped for better

Thought maybe together you and me would find it

I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere

Take your fast car and keep on driving



So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car

Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk

City lights lay out before us

And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder

And I-I, had a feeling that I belonged

I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone



You got a fast car

Is it fast enough so we can fly away?

Still gotta make a decision

Leave tonight or live and die this way"
"I don't understand why

See it's burning me to hold onto this

I know this is something I gotta do

But that don't mean I want to

What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just

I feel like this is coming to an end

And its better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you

I gotta let it burn



It's gonna burn for me to say this

But it's comin from my heart

It's been a long time coming

But we done been fell apart

Really wanna work this out

But I don't think you're gonna change

I do but you don't

Think it's best we go our separate ways

Tell me why I should stay in this relationship

When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby

Plus theres so many other things I gotta deal with

I think that you should let it burn



When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to

But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to

Even though this might bruise you

Let it burn

Let it burn

Gotta let it burn



Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you

Hate the thought of her being with someone else

But you know that it's over

We know that it's through

Let it burn

Let it burn

Gotta let it burn



Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to

Got somebody here but I want you

Cause the feelin ain't the same find myself

Callin' her your name

Ladies tell me do you understand?

Now all my fellas do you feel my pain?

It's the way I feel

I know I made a mistake

Now it's too late

I know she ain't comin back

What I gotta do now

To get my shorty back

Ooo ooo ooo ooooh

Man I don't know what I'm gonna do

Without my booo

You've been gone for too long

It's been fifty-leven days, um-teen hours

Imma be burnin' till you return (let it burn)



When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to

But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to

Even though this might bruise you

Let it burn (let it burn, let it burn, you gon'learn)

Let it burn (gotta let it burn)

Gotta let it burn



Deep down you know its best for yourself but you

Hate the thought of her being with someone else

But you know that it's over

We know that it's through

Let it burn

Let it burn

Gotta let it burn



I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on

On the other side I wanna break down and cry (ooooh)

I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on

On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah)



Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh

Ooh ooh oooh (can ya feel me burnin'?)

Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh oooh



So many days, so many hours

I'm still burnin' till you return



When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to

But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to

Even though this might bruise you

Let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you

Hate the thought of her being with someone else

But you know that it's over

We know that it's through

Let it burn

"Well I guess it would be nice

if I could touch your body

I know not everybody

has got a body like you

but I've got to think twice

before I give my heart away

and I know all the games you play

because I played them too



Oh but I

need some time off from that emotion

time to pick my heart up off the floor

and when that love comes down without devotion

well it takes a strong man baby

but I'm showing you the door



'Cause I've got to have faith

I've got to have faith

Because I've got to have faith, faith, faith

I've got to have faith, faith, faith



Baby

I know you're asking me to stay

say please please please don't go away

you say I'm giving you the blues

maybe

you mean every word you say

can't help but think of yesterday

and another who tied me down to loverboy rules



Before this river becomes an ocean

before you throw my heart back on the floor

oh baby I reconsider my foolish notion

well I need someone to hold me

but I'll wait for something more



Yes I've gotta have faith

I've got to have faith

Because I've got to have faith, faith, faith

I've got to have faith, faith, faith



I just got to wait because I've got to have faith

I gotta have faith... I gotta, gotta, gotta have faith



Before this river becomes an ocean

Before you throw my heart back on the floor

Oh baby I reconsider my foolish notion

Well I need someone to hold me 

But I'll wait for something more



'Cause I've got to have faith

I've got to have faith

Because I've got to have faith, faith, faith

I've got to have faith, faith, faith"
"You must understand

Though the touch of your hand

Makes my pulse react

That it's only the thrill

Of boy meeting girl

Opposites attract

It's physical

Only logical

You must try to ignore

That it means more than that



What's love got to do, got to do with it

What's love, but a second-hand emotion

What's love got to do, got to do with it

Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken



It may seem to you

That I'm acting confused

When you're close to me

If I tend to look dazed

I read it some place

I've got cause to be

There's a name for it

There's a phrase that fits

But whatever the reason

You do it for me, ooh



What's love got to do, got to do with it

What's love, but a second-hand emotion

What's love got to do, got to do with it

Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken



I've been taking on a new direction

But I have to say

I've been thinking 'bout my own protection

It scares me to feel this way, ooh



What's love got to do, got to do with it

What's love, but a second-hand emotion

What's love got to do, got to do with it

Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken



What's love got to do, got to do with it

What's love, but a sweet old fashioned notion

What's love got to do, got to do with it

Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken



(What's love got to do) Uh,got to do with it

(What's love... but a second-hand emotion)

What's love got to do, got to do with it

Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken

(What's love) uh uh, got to do with it..."
"At first I was afraid, I was petrified,

Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side,

But then I spent so many nights thinkin' how you did me wrong,

And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along,

And so your back, from outerspace,

I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face,

I should've changed that stupid lock,

I should've made you leave your key,

If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me,



Go on now go, walk out the door,

Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore,

Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye,

You think I'd crumble? You think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no not I, I will survive,

Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,

I've got all my life to live; I've got all my love to give,

And I'll survive, I will survive,

Hey, Hey!



It took all the strength I had not to fall apart,

And trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart,

And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself,

I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high,

And you'll see me, somebody new,

I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you,

And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free,

Now I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me. 



Go on now go, walk out the door,

Just turn around now, 'cause your not welcome anymore,

"(It must have been love...)

(But it's over now...)

Lay a whisper on my pillow

leave the winter on the ground

I wake up lonely, there's air of silence 

In the bedroom and all around. 

Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away.



It must have been love

But it's over now

It must have been good

But I lost it somehow

It must have been love

But it's over now

From the moment we touched

Till the time had run out



Make believing we're together

That I'm sheltered by your heart

But in and outside, I turn to water

Like a teardrop in your palm

And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away



It must have been love 

But it's over now 

It was all that I wanted

Now I'm living without

It must have been love 

But it's over now 

It's where the water flows

It's where the wind blows



It must have been love

But it's over now

It must have been good

But I lost it somehow

It must have been love

But it's over now

From the moment we touched

Till the time had run out



Yeah, it must have been love

But it's over now

It was all that I wanted

Now I'm living without

It must have been love

But it's over now

It's where the water flows

It's where the wind blows



(Must have been love but it's over now...)

(It must have been love but it's over now...)"

"The sun goes down the stars come out

And all that counts is here and now

My universe will never be the same I'm glad you came

You cast a spell on me, spell on me 
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me

And I decided you look well on me, well on me

So lets go somewhere no one else can see you and me



Turn the lights out now

Now I'll take you by the hand

Hand you another drink, drink it if you can,

Can you spend a little time

Time is slipping away

Away from us so stay

Stay with me I can make make you glad you came



The sun goes down the stars come out

And all that counts is here and now

My universe will never be the same I'm glad you came

"Now and then I think of when we were together

Like when you said you felt so happy you could die

Told myself that you were right for me

But felt so lonely in your company

But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness

Like resignation to the end

Always the end

So when we found that we could not make sense

Well you said that we would still be friends

But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over



But you didn't have to cut me off

Make out like it never happened

And that we were nothing

And I don't even need your love

But you treat me like a stranger

And that feels so rough

You didn't have to stoop so low

Have your friends collect your records

And then change your number

I guess that I don't need that though

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know



Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over

But had me believing it was always something that I'd done

And I don't wanna live that way

Reading into every word you say

You said that you could let it go

And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...



But you didn't have to cut me off

Make out like it never happened

And that we were nothing

And I don't even need your love

But you treat me like a stranger

Have your friends collect your records

Singing my life with his words

Killing me softly with his song

Killing me softly with his song

Telling my whole life with his words

Killing me softly with his song



I heard he sang a good song

I heard he had a style

And so I came to see him

To listen for a while

And there he was this young boy

A stranger to my eyes



Strumming my pain with his fingers

Singing my life with his words

Killing me softly with his song

Killing me softly with his song

Telling my whole life with his words

Killing me softly with his song



I felt all flushed with fever

Embarassed by the crowd

I felt he found my letters

And read each one out loud

I prayed that he would finish

But he just kept right on



Strumming my pain with his fingers

Singing my life with his words

Killing me softly with his song

Killing me softly with his song

Telling my whole life with his words

Killing me softly with his song



He sang as if he knew me

In all my dark despair

And then he looked right through me

As if I wasn't there

And he just kept on singing

Singing clear and strong



Strumming my pain with his fingers

Singing my life with his words

Killing me softly with his song

Killing me softly with his song

We were as one, babe 

For a moment in time 

And it seemed everlasting 

That you would always be mine 

Now you want to be free 

So I'll let you fly 

'Cause I know in my heart, babe 

Our love will never die 

No 



You'll always be a part of me 

I'm part of you indefinitely 

Boy, don't you know you can't escape me 

Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby 

And we'll linger on 

Time can't erase a feeling this strong 

No way you're never gonna shake me

Oh baby, baby

How was I supposed to know

That something wasn't right here?

Oh baby, baby

I shouldn't have let you go

And now you're out of sight, yeah



Show me how you want it to be

Tell me, baby, cause I need to know now, oh, because



My loneliness is killing me

When I'm not with you, I lose my mind

Give me a sign

Hit me baby one more time



Oh baby, baby

The reason I breathe is you

Boy, you got me blinded

Oh, pretty baby

There's nothing that I wouldn't do

It's not the way I planned it

"Gonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight

Gonna grab some afternoon delight

My motto's always been 'when it's right, it's right'

Why wait until the middle of a cold dark night?

When everything's a little clearer in the light of day

And we know the night is always gonna be there any way



Thinkin' of you's workin' up my appetite

Looking forward to a little afternoon delight

Rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ingite

And the thought of lovin' you is getting so exciting

Sky rockets in flight

Afternoon delight

Afternoon delight

Afternoon delight



Started out this morning feeling so polite

I always though a fish could not be caught who wouldn't bite

But you've got some bait a waitin' and I think I might try nibbling

A little afternoon delight

Sky rockets in flight

Afternoon delight

Afternoon delight

Afternoon delight



Please be waiting for me, baby, when I come around

We could make a lot of lovin' 'for the sun goes down



Thinkin' of you's workin' up my appetite

Looking forward to a little afternoon delight

Rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ingite

And the thought of lovin' you is getting so exciting

Sky rockets in flight

Afternoon delight

Afternoon delight

Afternoon delight!"

"Well I guess it would be nice

if I could touch your body

I know not everybody

has got a body like you

but I've got to think twice

before I give my heart away

and I know all the games you play

because I played them too



Oh but I

need some time off from that emotion

time to pick my heart up off the floor

and when that love comes down without devotion

well it takes a strong man baby

but I'm showing you the door



'Cause I've got to have faith

I've got to have faith

Because I've got to have faith, faith, faith

I've got to have faith, faith, faith



Baby

I know you're asking me to stay

say please please please don't go away

you say I'm giving you the blues

maybe

you mean every word you say

can't help but think of yesterday

and another who tied me down to loverboy rules



Before this river becomes an ocean

before you throw my heart back on the floor

oh baby I reconsider my foolish notion

well I need someone to hold me

but I'll wait for something more



Yes I've gotta have faith

I've got to have faith

Because I've got to have faith, faith, faith

I've got to have faith, faith, faith



I just got to wait because I've got to have faith

I gotta have faith... I gotta, gotta, gotta have faith



Before this river becomes an ocean

Before you throw my heart back on the floor

Oh baby I reconsider my foolish notion

Well I need someone to hold me 

But I'll wait for something more



'Cause I've got to have faith

I've got to have faith

Because I've got to have faith, faith, faith

I've got to have faith, faith, faith"
"You're just too good to be true

Can't take my eyes off of you

You'd be like heaven to touch

I wanna hold you so much

At long last love has arrived

And I thank God I'm alive

You're just too good to be true

Can't take my eyes off of you



Pardon the way that I stare

There's nothing else to compare

The sight of you leaves me weak

There are no words left to speak

But if you feel like I feel

Please let me know that it's real

You're just too good to be true

Can't take my eyes off of you



I love you baby and if it's quite all right

I need you baby to warm the lonely nights

I love you baby, trust in me when I say

Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down I pray

Oh pretty baby, now that I've found you stay

And let me love you baby, let me love you



You're just too good to be true

Can't take my eyes off of you

You'd be like heaven to touch

I wanna hold you so much

At long last love has arrived

And I thank God I'm alive

You're just too good to be true

Can't take my eyes off of you



I love you baby and if it's quite all right

I need you baby to warm the lonely nights

I love you baby, trust in me when I say

Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down I pray

Oh pretty baby, now that I've found you stay

Oh pretty baby, trust in me when I say"
"I'm glad you're home

Well, did you really miss me?

I guess you did by the look in your eye (look in your eye, look in your eye)

You can ring my be-e-ell, ring my bell

You can ring my be-e-ell, ring my bell

You can ring my be-e-ell, ring my bell

You can ring my be-e-ell, ring my bell



The night is young and full of possibilities

Tonight was made for me and you

"Memories
Light the corners of my mind
Misty watercolor memories
Of the way we were
Scattered pictures
Of the smiles we left behind

Smiles we gave to one another

For the way we were



Can it be that it was all so simple then

Or has time rewritten every line

If we had the chance to do it all again

Tell me - Would we? Could we?



Memories

May be beautiful and yet

So much memories

What's too painful to remember

Of the way we were



Can it be that it was all so simple then

Or has time rewritten every line

If we had the chance to do it all again

Tell me - Would we? Could we?



Memories

May be beautiful and yet

Much too painful to remember

We simply choose to forget



So it's the laughter

We will remember

Whenever we remember

The way we were

The way we were

The way we were

The way we were so much baby

I miss the way we were"

"Where is the moment we needed the most 
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost 
They tell me your blue skies fade to grey 
They tell me your passion's gone away 
And I don't need no carryin' on 


You stand in the line just to hit a new low 

You're faking a smile with the coffee to go 

You tell me your life's been way off line 

You're falling to pieces everytime 

And I don't need no carryin' on 



Cause you had a bad day 

You're taking one down 

You sing a sad song just to turn it around 

You say you don't know 

You tell me don't lie 

You work at a smile and you go for a ride 

You had a bad day 

The camera don't lie 

You're coming back down and you really don't mind

And the whole thing turns out wrong 

You might not make it back and you know 

That you could be well oh that strong

So where is the passion when you need it the most 

Oh you and I 

You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost 



Cause you had a bad day 

You're taking one down 

You sing a sad song just to turn it around 

You say you don't know 

You tell me don't lie 

You work at a smile and you go for a ride 

You had a bad day 

You've seen what you like

"There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, 
it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go head and sell me out 
and I'll lay your shit bare



See how I leave with every piece of you

Don't underestimate the things that I will do



There's a fire starting in my heart

Reaching a fever pitch

And its bring me out the dark



The scars of your love remind me of us

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

The scars of your love they leave me breathless

I can't help feeling

We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it

To the beat



Baby I have no story to be told

But I've heard one of you

And I'm gonna make your head burn

Think of me in the depths of your despair

Making a home down there

It Reminds you of the home we shared



The scars of your love remind me of us

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

The scars of your love they leave me breathless

I can't help feeling

We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it

To the beat



We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it

To the beat



Throw your soul through every open door

Count your blessings to find what you look for

Turned my sorrow into treasured gold

You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow



We could have had it all

We could have had it all

It all, it all it all,

We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it

To the beat



We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it, you played it, you played it

To the beat"
"He's a cold-hearted snake

Look into his eyes

Oh ohhh

He's been tellin' lies

He's a lover boy at play

He don't play by rules

Oh oh

Girl don't play the fool--no



You're the one givin' up the love

Anytime he needs it

But you turn your back and then he's off

and runnin' with the crowd

You're the one to sacrifice

Anything to please him

Do you really think he thinks about you

when he's out



He's a cold-hearted snake

Look into his eyes

Oh ohhh

He's been tellin' lies

He's a lover boy at play

He don't play by rules

Oh oh oh

Girl don't play the fool--no



It was only late last night

He was out there sneakin'

Then he called you up to check that you

were waiting by the phone

All the world's a candy store

He's been trick or treatin'

When it comes to true love girl with him

there's no one home



He's a cold-hearted snake

Look into his eyes

Oh ohh

He's been tellin' lies

He's a lover boy at play

He don't play by rules

Oh oh oh

Girl don't play the fool--no



You could find somebody better girl

He could only make you cry

You deserve somebody better girl

He's c-cold as ice

He's been tellin' lies

He's a lover boy at play

He don't play by rules

How come how come he can he can tell-a tell-a you're-a you're-a

Always always number number one without a doubt

When-a when-a he is he is always always squirmin' squirmin'

Like a little snake under-a e-ver-y-a rock

(No no give give, all all take take)

You've been you've been workin' workin' on the on the love

And he's been only only playing undercover all the while

(One one smooth smooth sharp sharp tongue tongue)

"Cryin' on my pillow, lonely in my bed

then a heard a voice beside me, and she softly said

wonder is your night light, magic is your dream

and as i held her, she said, see what i mean

i said what? She said oo-oo-oo-wee

i said alright! She said, love me love me love me



undercover angel, midnight fantasy

i've never had a dream that made sweet love to me

undercover angel, answer to my prayer

you made me know that there's a love for me

out there, somewhere



heavenly surrender, sweet afterglow

given up my heart to you, now angel don't go

she said, go find the right one, love her and then

when you look into her eyes, you'll see me again



i said what? She said oo-oo-oo-wee

i said alright! She said, love me love me love me



(repeat chorus)



now you know my story, and girl if it's right

i'm gonna take you in my arms and love you tonight

she said alright! I said, love me love me love me

"Here I stand,
watching the tide go out,
so all alone and blue,
just dreaming dreams of you.
I watched your ship,
as it sailed out to sea,
Why oh why,
must I go on like this?
Shall taking all my dreams
and taking all of me.
I just be alonely stranger on the shore?
The sighing of waves,
the wailing of the wing.
The tears in my eyes burn,
pleading \""My love, return\""."

Tried to keep my hands on the table

We tapping right into your memory banks (Thanks!)

Then the whole room fell silent (Shhhhh!)

The girls all pause with glee, turning left turning right hardly looking at me,

But I was looking at them, there, there on the dance floor

Now they got me in the middle feeling like a man whore

Specially the big girl, big girls need love too no discrimination in this world.

So keep your hands off my cheeks, and let me study how you ride the beat 

You big freak!

Skinny, slim women got the ghetto within them 

You can fuck them, lift them, bend them, give them something to remember

Hail out timber when you fall through the chop shop.

Take a deep a breath and exhale your ex male friend, boyfriend was boring as hell

Now let me listen to the stories you tell and we can make moves like a person in jail.

On the loco

"There are times when a woman

has to say what's on her mind

eventhough she knows how much its gonna hurt

Before I say another word

let me tell you, I love you

let me hold you close and say these words

as gently as I can



There's been another man

that I've meeted and I love

But that doesn't mean I love you less

And he knows he can't posses me

and he knows he never will

Is just this empty place inside of me

That only he can fill



Torn between two lovers

feelin like a fool

Loving both of you

Is breaking all the rules

Torn between two lovers

feelin like a fool

Loving you both is breaking all the rules



You musn't think you failed me

just because there's someone else

you were the first real love I've ever had

And all the things I ever said

I swear they still are true

For no one else can have the part of me I gave to you



Torn between two lovers

feelin like a fool

Loving both of you

Is breaking all the rules

Torn between two lovers

feelin like a fool

Loving you both is breaking all the rules



Couldn't really blame you

if you turn and walk away

But with everything I feel inside

I'm asking you to stay

Loving both of you

Should stay

"I've been alone with you

Inside my mind

And in my dreams I've kissed your lips

A thousand times

I sometimes see you

Pass outside my door

Hello!

Is it me you're looking for?

I can see it in your eyes

I can see it in your smile

You're all I've ever wanted

And my arms are open wide

Cause you know just what to say

And you know just what to do

And I want to tell you so much

I love you



I long to see the sunlight in your hair

And tell you time and time again

How much I care

Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow

Hello!

I've just got to let you know

Cause I wonder where you are

And I wonder what you do

Are you somewhere feeling lonely?

Or is someone loving you?

Tell me how to win your heart

For I haven't got a clue

But let me start by saying I love you



Hello!

Is it me you're looking for?

Cause I wonder where you are

And I wonder what you do

Are you somewhere feeling lonely?

Or is someone loving you?

Tell me how to win your heart

For I haven't got a clue

But let me start by saying I love you"
"I didn't mean it
When I said I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight
I never should've let you go
I didn't know nothing
I was stupid

I was foolish

I was lying to myself

I couldn't have fathomed that I would ever

Be without your love

Never imagined I'd be

Sitting here beside myself



'Cause I didn't know you

'Cause I didn't know me

But I thought I knew everything

I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling

Now that I don't

Hear your voice

Or have your touch and kiss your lips

Cause I don't have a choice

Oh, what I wouldn't give

To have you lying by my side

Right here, 'cause baby



When you left

I lost a part of me

It's still so hard to believe

Come back baby please, 'cause

We belong together

Who else am I gonna lean on

When times get rough

Who's gonna talk to me on the phone

Till the sun comes up

Who's gonna take your place

There ain't nobody better

Oh baby, baby

We belong together



I can't sleep at night

When you are on my mind

Bobby Womack's on the radio

Singing to me

'If you think you're lonely now'

Wait a minute

This is too deep, too deep

I gotta change the station

So I turn the dial

Trying to catch a break

And then I hear Babyface

I only think of you

And it's breaking my heart

I'm trying to keep it together

But I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element

I'm throwing things

Crying

Trying to figure out

Where the hell I went wrong

The pain reflected in this song

Ain't even half of what

I'm feeling inside

I need you

Need you back in my life baby



When you left

I lost a part of me

It's still so hard to believe

Come back baby please, 'cause

We belong together

Who else am I gonna lean on

When times get rough

Who's gonna talk to me on the phone

Till the sun comes up

Who's gonna take your place

There ain't nobody better

Oh baby, baby

We belong together



When you left

I lost a part of me

It's still so hard to believe

Come back baby please, 'cause

We belong together

Who am I gonna lean on

When times get rough

Who's gonna talk to me

Till the sun comes up

Who's gonna take your place

There ain't nobody better

Oh baby, baby

We belong together"
"You'd think that people 
Would have had enough 
Of silly love songs 
I look around me and I see it isn't so 
Some people wanna fill the world 
With silly love songs 

And what's wrong with that? 

I'd like to know 

'cause here I go again 

I love you, I love you 



I can't explain the feeling's plain to me; 

Can't you see? 

Ah, she gave me more, 

She gave it all to me now can't you see? 

What's wrong with that? 

I need to know 



Love doesn't come in a minute 

Sometimes it doesn't come at all 

I only know that when I'm in it 

It isn't silly, love isn't silly, 

Love isn't silly at all 



How can I tell you about my loved one? 

How can I tell you about my loved one?"
"I've been walkin' these streets so long

Singin' the same old song

I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway

Where hustle's the name of the game

And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain

There's been a load of compromisin'

On the road to my horizon

But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me



Like a rhinestone cowboy

Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

Like a rhinestone cowboy

Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know

And offers comin' over the phone



Well, I really don't mind the rain

And a smile can hide all the pain

But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way

And I dream of the things I'll do

With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe

There'll be a load of compromisin'

On the road to my horizon

But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me



Like a rhinestone cowboy

Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

Rhinestone cowboy

Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know

And offers comin' over the phone



Like a rhinestone cowboy

Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo



Like a rhinestone cowboy

Gettin' card and letters from people I don't even know"

Get through the night without you?

If I had to live without you,

What kind of life would that be?

If you ever leave,

baby you would take away everything good in my life,

How do I live without you?

I want to know,

How do I breathe without you?

If you ever go,

How do I ever, ever survive?

How do I, how do I, oh how do I live? 



Without you,

There'd be no sun in my sky,

There would be no love in my life,

There'd be no world left for me.

And I,

Baby I don't know what I would do,

I'd be lost if I lost you,

If you ever leave,

Baby you would take away everything real in my life,

"We were good, we were gold

Kind of dream that can't be sold

We were right 'til we weren't

Built a home and watched it burn

I can buy myself flowers

Write my name in the sand

Talk to myself for hours

Say things you don't understand

I can take myself dancing

And I can hold my own hand

Yeah, I can love me better than you can



Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby



Paint my nails cherry red

Match the roses that you left

No remorse, no regret

"I used to be a rolling stone

You know if the cause was right

I'd leave to find the answer on the road

I used to be a heart beating for someone

But the times have changed

The less I say the more my work gets done



`Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom

From the day that I was born I've waved the flag

Philadelphia freedom took me knee-high to a man

Yeah gave me peace of mind my daddy never had



Oh Philadelphia freedom shine on me, I love you

Shine a light through the eyes of the ones left behind

Shine a light shine a light

Shine a light won't you shine a light

Philadelphia freedom I love you, yes I do



If you choose to you can live your life alone

Some people choose the city

Some others choose the good old family home

I like living easy without family ties

Till the whippoorwill of freedom zapped me

Right between the eyes"

Four years, no calls

Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar and

I-I-I can't stop

No, I-I-I can't stop



So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover

That I know you can't afford

Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Pull the sheets right off the corner

Of the mattress that you stole

From your roommate back in Boulder

We ain't ever getting older



We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older



You look as good as the day I met you

I forget just why I left you, I was insane

Stay, and play that Blink-182 song

That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

Pull the sheets right off the corner

Of the mattress that you stole

From your roommate back in Boulder

We ain't ever getting older



We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older



So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover

That I know you can't afford

Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Pull the sheets right off the corner

Of the mattress that you stole

From your roommate back in Boulder

We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older (no we ain't ever getting older)

We ain't ever getting older (no we ain't ever getting older)

We ain't ever getting older (we ain't ever getting older)

We ain't ever getting older (no we ain't ever getting older)



We ain't ever getting older

No we ain't ever getting older"
"Hey, hey, hey, hey

Oh, oh, oh-oh

Oh, oh, oh-oh

Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

We couldn't turn around

'Til we were upside down

I'll be the bad guy now

But no, I ain't too proud

Why could it be that?

Even when I try

You don't believe it

We do this every time



Seasons change and our love went cold

Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go

Run away but we're running in circles

Run away, run away

I dare you to do something

I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame

Run away but we're running in circles

Run away, run away, run away, oh



I got a feeling it's time to let go

I said so,

I knew that this was doomed from the get-go

You thought that it was special, special

But it was just a sex doll, the sex doll

And I still hear the echoes, echoes

I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go



Seasons change and our love went cold

Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go

Run away but we're running in circles

Run away, run away

I dare you to do something

I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame

Run away but we're running in circles

Run away, run away, run away



Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through

It's only me, what you got to lose?

Make up your mind, tell me what are you gonna do

It's only me, let it go



Seasons change and our love went cold

Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go

Run away but we're running in circles

Run away, run away

I dare you to do something

I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame

Run away but we're running in circles

Run away, run away, run away"
"Jeremiah was a bullfrog

Was a good friend of mine

I never understood a single word he said

But I helped him a-drink his wine

And he always had some mighty fine wine

Singin'...



Joy to the world

All the boys and girls now

Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea

Joy to you and me



If I were the king of the world

Tell you what I'd do

I'd throw away the cars and the bars and the war

Make sweet love to you

Sing it now...



Joy to the world

All the boys and girls

Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea

Joy to you and me

You know I love the ladies

Love to have my fun

"Monica 
Excuse me do I know you cause uhh, you know you look kinda familiar? 
Brandy 
Yeah, you do too but, umm, I just wanted to know do you know somebody named you, you know his name. 


Monica 

Oh, yeah definitely I know his name. 



Brandy 

I just wanted to let you know he's mine. 



Monica 

Huh..no no, he's mine. 



(chorus) 

You need to give it up. 

Had about enough. 

It's not hard to see, the boy is mine. 

I'm sorry that you 

Seem to be confused 

He belongs to me 

The boy is mine 



Brandy 

I think it's time we got this straight 

let's sit and talk face to face 

There is no way you could mistake 

him for your man - are you insane? 



Monica 

See I know that you may be 

just a bit jealous of me. 

But you're blind If you can't see 

that his love is all in me. 



Brandy 

You see I try to hesitate 

I didn't want to say what he told me 

He said without me he couldn't make 

it through the day, ain't that a shame. 



Monica 

Maybe your misunderstood 

Cause I can't see how he could 

wanna change something that's so good 

Because my love was all it took. 



(Chorus) 



Monica 

Must you do the things you do 

keep on acting like a fool 

You need to know it's me not you 

And if you didn't know it girl, it's true. 



Brandy 

I think that you should realize 

I'm trying to understand why 

He is a part of my life 

I know it's killing you inside. 



Monica 

You can say what you want to say 

What we have you can't take 

From the truth you can't escape 

I can tell the real from the fake. 



Brandy 

When will you get the picture 

Your the past I'm the future 

Get away it's my time to shine 

if you didn't know the boy is mine. 



(chorus x2) 



Monica 

You can't destroy this love I've found 

Your silly games I won't allow 

the boy is mine without a doubt 

You might as well throw in the towel. 

Brandy 

What makes you think that he wants you 

when I'm the one that brought him to 

special places in my heart 

Cause he was my love from the start 



(chorus x2) 



Monica 

Not yours! 



Brandy 

But mine!

"(Rod Stewart)

Stay away from my window

Stay away from my back door too

Disconnect the telephone line

Relax baby and draw that blind



Kick off your shoes and sit right down

Loosen off that pretty French gown

Let me pour you a good long drink

Ooh baby don't you hesitate cause



Tonight's the night

It's gonna be alright

Cause I love you girl

Ain't nobody gonna stop us now



C'mon angel my hearts on fire

Don't deny your man's desire

You'd be a fool to stop this tide

Spread your wings and let me come inside



Tonight's the night

It's gonna be alright

Cause I love you girl

Ain't nobody gonna stop us now



Don't say a word my virgin child

Just let your 

inhibitions run wild

The secret is about to unfold

Upstairs before the night's too old



Tonight's the night

It's gonna be alright

Cause I love you girl

Ain't nobody gonna stop us now"
"Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard,
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars, yeah we'll be counting stars


I see this life like a swinging vine

Swing my heart across the line

And my face is flashing signs

Seek it out and you shall find

Old, but I'm not that old

Young, but I'm not that bold

I don't think the world is sold

I'm just doing what we're told

I feel something so right

Doing the wrong thing

I feel something so wrong

Doing the right thing

I could lie, coudn't I, could lie

Everything that kills me makes me feel alive



Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep

Dreaming about the things that we could be

Down this river, every turn

Hope is a four-letter word

Make that money, watch it burn

Old, but I'm not that old

Young, but I'm not that bold

I don't think the world is sold

I'm just doing what we're told

I feel something so wrong

Doing the right thing

I could lie, could lie, could lie

Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

Dreaming about the things that we could be

Dreaming about the things that we could be

Sink in the river

"Psst, I see dead people

Ayy, Mustard on the beat, ho

Deebo any rap nigga, he a free throw

Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, \""Breathe, bro\""

Nail a nigga to the cross, he walk around like Teezo

What's up with these jabroni-ass niggas tryna see Compton?

The industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama

How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options

I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton

Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'

Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas

Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em

Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho in him

Pole on him, extort shit, bully, Death Row on him

Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young

You better not ever go to cell block one

To any bitch that talk to him and they in love

Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him

They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs

And Party at the party playin' with his nose now

And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?

Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles

Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up

Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff

Why you trollin' like a bitch? Ain't you tired?

Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor



They not like us, they not like us, they not like us

They not like us, they not like us, they not like us



You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac, nigga?

I think that Oakland show gon' be your last stop, nigga

Did Cole fouI, I don't know why you still pretendin'

What is the owl? Bird niggas and bird bitches, go

The audience not dumb

Shape the stories how you want, hey, Drake, they're not slow

Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise

Ain't that somethin'? B-Rad stands for bitch and you Malibu most wanted

Ain't no law, boy, you ball boy, fetch Gatorade or somethin'

Since 2009, I had this bitch jumpin'

You niggas'll get a wedgie, be flipped over your boxers

What OVO for? The \""Other Vaginal Option\""? Pussy

Nigga better straighten they posture, got famous all up in Compton

Might write this for the doctorate, tell the pop star, \""Quit hidin'\""

Fuck a caption, want action, no accident

And I'm hands-on, he fuck around, get polished

Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'

Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin'

I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither

From Alondra down to Central, nigga better not speak on Serena

And your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks

That name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch

I lean on you niggas like another line of Wock'

Yeah, it's all eyes on me, and I'ma send it up to Pac, ayy

Put the wrong label on me, I'ma get 'em dropped, ayy

Sweet Chin Music and I won't pass the aux, ayy

How many stocks do I really have in stock? Ayy

One, two, three, four, five, plus five, ayy

Devil is a lie, he a 69 God, ayy

Freaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside, ayy

Roll they ass up like a fresh pack of 'za, ayy

City is back up, it's a must, we outside, ayy



They not like us, they not like us, they not like us

They not like us, they not like us, they not like us



Once upon a time, all of us was in chains

Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves

Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains

Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game

The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer

Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda

You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance

Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge

You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)

Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)

21 gave you false street cred

Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)

Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)

2 Chainz say you good, but he lied

You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars

No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer

The family matter and the truth of the matter

It was God's plan to show y'all the liar



Mm

Mm-mm

He a fan, he a fan, he a fan (Mm)

Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God

"I fall to pieces,

Each time I see you again.

I fall to pieces.

How can I be just your friend?

You want me to act like we've never kissed.

You want me to forget, pretend we've never met.

And I've tried and I've tried, but I haven't yet.

You walk by and I fall to pieces.



I fall to pieces,

Each time someone speaks your name.

I fall to pieces.

Time only adds to the flame.



You tell me to find someone else to love,

Someone who'll love me too, the way you used to do.

But each time I go out with some one new,

You walk by and I fall to pieces.



You walk by and I fall to pieces."

Slide your feet up the street, bend your back

Shift your arm, then you pull it back

Life is hard, you know (oh whey oh)

So strike a pose on a Cadillac.



If you want to find all the cops

They're hanging out in the donut shop

They sing and dance (oh whey oh)

Spin the clubs, cruise down the block.

Lift your open hand. 

Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance, 

Silver moon's sparkling. 

So kiss me. 



Kiss me down by the broken tree house. 

Swing me upon its hanging tire. 

Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat. 

We'll take the trail marked on your father's map.

"Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show

I laced the track, you locked the flow

So far from hangin' on the block for dough

Notorious, they got to know that

Life ain't always what it seem to be

Words can't express what you mean to me

Even though you're gone, we still a team

Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream, that's right

In the future, can't wait to see

If you open up the gates for me

Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend

Try to black it out, but it plays again

When it's real, feelings hard to conceal

Can't imagine all the pain I feel

Give anythin' to hear half your breath, half your breath

I know you still livin' your life, after death



Every step I take, every move I make

Every single day, every time I pray

I'll be missing you

Thinkin' of the day, when you went away

What a life to take, what a bond to break

I'll be missin' you



It's kinda hard with you not around

Know you in heaven smilin' down

Watchin' us while we pray for you

Every day we pray for you

'til the day we meet again

In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend

Memories give me the strength I need to proceed

Strength I need to believe

My thoughts Big I just can't define

Wish I could turn back the hands of time

Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks

You and me takin' flicks

Makin' hits, stages they receive you on

Still can't believe you're gone

Give anything to hear half your breath

I know you still livin' your life, after death



Every step I take, every move I make

Every single day, every time I pray

I'll be missing you

Thinkin' of the day, when you went away

What a life to take, what a bond to break

I'll be missin' you



Somebody tell me why

One black morning

When this life is over

I know

I'll see your face



Every night I pray, every step I take

Every move I make, every single day

Every night I pray, every step I take

Every day that passes

Every move I make, every single day

Is a day that I get closer

To seeing you again

Every night I pray, every step I take

We miss you B.I.G., and we won't stop

Every move I make, every single day

Cause we can't stop... that's right

Every night I pray, every step I take

Every move I make, every single day

We miss you B.I.G"

All that's left of the dreams I hold

And the memories of what love could be

If you were still here with me



You took me from the shelter of my mother

I had never known or loved any other

We kissed after taking vows

But that night on our honeymoon,

We stayed in separate rooms



I wait in the darkness of my lonely room

Filled with sadness, filled with gloom

Hoping soon

That you'll walk back through that door

And love me like you tried before



Since you've been gone,

All that's left is a band of gold

All that's left of the dreams I hold

"She wore blue velvet 
Bluer than velvet was the night 
Softer than satin was the light 
From the stars 
She wore blue velvet 
Bluer than velvet were her eyes 

Warmer than May her tender sighs 

Love was ours 

Ours a love I held tightly 

Feeling the rapture grow 

Like a flame burning brightly 

But when she left, gone was the glow of 

Blue velvet 

But in my heart there'll always be 

Precious and warm, a memory 

Through the years 

And I still can see blue velvet 

Through my tears"

I'm that Goodfella fly guy, sometimes wiseguys

Spend time in H-A-W-A-I-I

(Mase can you please stop smoking lah lah?)

Puff why try? I'm a thug, I'ma die high

I be out in Jersey, puffin Hershey

Brothers ain't worthy to rock my derby

Though I'm never drugged, I'm the venom in the club, G

Though I know the thug be wantin to slug me (uh-huh)

Could it be I move as smoove as Bugsy? (yeah)

Or be at the bar with too much bubbly? (c'mon)

Yo I think it must be the girls want to lust me

Or is it simply the girls just love me

Brothers wanna: rock the Rolls, rock my clothes

Rock my ice, pull out Glocks, stop my life (uhh)

I'm like, \""Damn, how these niggaz got they trust?

Used to be my man, how you gonna plot on my wife?\""

Do you think you snake me, cause they hate me?

Or he got his Ph.D; Player Hater's Degree? (Ahaha!)



{Chorus: Mase, Puff Daddy}



{Mase} Can't nobody take my pride

{Puff} Uh-uh, uh-uh

{Mase} Can't nobody hold me down... ohh no

{Mase} I got to keep on movin



{Verse Three: Mase}



Quit that! (uh-huh) You a big cat? (yeah)

Where your chicks at? (yeah) Where your whips at? (where dey at?)

Wherever you get stacks, I'ma fix that

Everything that's big dreams, I did that (that's right)

Don't knock me cause you're boring

I'm record sales soaring (*whistling*) straight touring

Simply a lot of men be wantin to hear me

cause their words just don't offend me (uh-uh, uh-uh)

We spend cheese, in the West Indies

Then come home to plenty cream Bentleys (ahehe)

You name it, I could claim it

Young, black, and famous, with money hangin out the anus

And when you need a hit, who you go and get? (who?)

Bet against us? (Not a sure bet)

We make hits that'll rearrange your whole set (that's right)

and got a Benz that I ain't even drove yet



{Mase} Don't push us, cause we're close to the, edge

{Mase} We're tryin, not to, lose our heads, a-hah-hah-hah-hah



{Mase} I get the feeling sometime, that make me wonder

{Mase} Why you wanna take us under

{Puff} Why you wanna take us under

"There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of 
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above 
Ooh I lose control, can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love

How will I know (Don't trust your feelings) 

How will I know 

How will I know (Love can be deceiving) 

How will I know 

How will I know if he really loves me 

I say a prayer with every heart beat 

I fall in love whenever we meet 

I'm asking you what you know about these things 

How will I know if he's thinking of me 

I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak) 

Falling in love is all bitter sweet 

This love is strong why do I feel weak



Oh, wake me, I'm shaking, wish I had you near me now 

Said there's no mistaking, what I feel is really love 



How will I know (Don't trust your feelings) 

How will I know 

How will I know (Love can be deceiving) 

How will I know 

How will I know if he really loves me 

I say a prayer with every heart beat 

I fall in love whenever we meet 

I'm asking you what you know about these things 

How will I know if he's thinking of me 

I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak) 

Falling in love is all bitter sweet 

This love is strong why do I feel weak



If he loves me, if he loves me not

If he loves me, if he loves me not

If he loves me, if he loves me not



How will I know (Don't trust your feelings) 

How will I know 

How will I know (Love can be deceiving) 

How will I know 

How will I know if he really loves me 

I say a prayer with every heart beat 

I fall in love whenever we meet 

I'm asking you what you know about these things 

How will I know if he's thinking of me

Falling in love is all bitter sweet 

This love is strong why do I feel weak"
"Those schoolgirl days, of telling tales and biting nails are gone,

But in my mind,

I know they will still live on and on,

But how do you thank someone, who has taken you from crayons to perfume?

It isn't easy, but I'll try,

If you wanted the sky I would write across the sky in letters,

That would soar a thousand feet high,

To Sir, with Love



The time has come,

For closing books and long last looks must end,

And as I leave,

I know that I am leaving my best friend,

A friend who taught me right from wrong, 

And weak from strong,

That's a lot to learn,

What, what can I give you in return?



If you wanted the moon I would try to make a start,

But I, would rather you let me give my heart,

To Sir, with Love"
"I got my driver's license last week

Just like we always talked about

'Cause you were so excited for me

To finally drive up to your house

But today I drove through the suburbs

Crying 'cause you weren't around



And you're probably with that blonde girl

Who always made me doubt

She's so much older than me

She's everything I'm insecure about

Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs

'Cause how could I ever love someone else?



And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one

And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone

Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me

'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street



And all my friends are tired

Of hearing how much I miss you but

I kinda feel sorry for them

'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do

Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs

And pictured I was driving home to you



And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one

Oh, and I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone

I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me

'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street



Red lights

Stop signs

I still see your face

In the white cars

Front yards

Can't drive past the places

We used to

Go to

'Cause I still fucking love you, babe



Sidewalks

We crossed

I still hear your voice

In the traffic

We're laughing

Over all the noise

God, I'm so blue

Know we're through

But I still fucking love you, babe



I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one

And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone

Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me

'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street

Yeah, you said forever now I drive alone past your street"
"I can feel magic floating in the air

Being with you gets me that way

I watch the sunlight dance across your face

And I've never been this swept away

All my thoughts just seem 

To settle on the breeze

When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms

The whole world just fades away

The only thing I hear

Is the beating of your heart



And I can feel you breathe

It's washing over me

And suddenly I'm melting into you

There's nothing left to prove

Baby all we need is just to be

Caught up in the touch

A slow and steady rush

Baby isn't that the way 

That love's supposed to be

I can feel you breathe

Just breathe



In a way I know my heart is waking up

As all the walls come tumbling down

Closer than I've ever felt before

And I know and you know

There's no need for words right now



Cause I can feel you breathe

It's washing over me

And suddenly I'm melting into you

There's nothing left to prove

Baby all we need is just to be

Caught up in the touch

A slow and steady rush

And baby isn't that the way 

That love's supposed to be

I can feel you breathe

Just breathe



Caught up in the touch

A slow and steady rush

And baby isn't that the way 

That love's supposed to be

I can feel you breathe

Just breathe



I can feel the magic floating in the air

Being with you gets me that way"
"How can I just let you walk away, just let you leave without a trace

When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh

You're the only one who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me,

when all I can do is watch you leave

Cos we've shared the laughter and the pain and even shared the tears

You're the only one who really knew me at all



So take a look at me now, oh there's just an empty space

And there's nothing left here to remind me,

just the memory of your face

Ooh take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space

And you coming back to me is against all odds and that's what I've got to face



I wish I could just make you turn around,

turn around and see me cry

There's so much I need to say to you,

so many reasons why

You're the only one who really knew me at all



So take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space

And there's nothing left here to remind me, just the memory of your face

Now take a look at me now, cos there's just an empty space



But to wait for you, is all I can do and that's what I've got to face

Take a good look at me now, cos I'll still be standing here

And you coming back to me is against all odds 

It's the chance I've gotta take



Take a look at me now"

Road shimmer wigglin' the vision

Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a—



Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now

Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now



Usually I put somethin' on TV

So we never think about you and me

But today I see our reflections clearly

In Hollywood, layin' on the screen

You just need a better life than this

You need somethin' I can never give

Fake water all across the road

It's gone now, the night has come, but



Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now



You can't fight it, you can't breathe

You say somethin' so lovin', but

Now I gotta let you go

You'll be better off in someone new

I don't wanna be alone

You know it hurts me too

You look so broken when you cry

One more and then I say goodbye



Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now

Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now



I just wonder what you're dreamin' of

When you sleep and smile so comfortable

I just wish that I could give you that

That look that's perfectly un-sad

Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Heat waves been fakin' me out



Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now

Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now

Stay away from my window

Stay away from my back door too

Disconnect the telephone line

Relax baby and draw that blind



Kick off your shoes and sit right down

Loosen off that pretty French gown

Let me pour you a good long drink

Ooh baby don't you hesitate cause



Tonight's the night

It's gonna be alright

Cause I love you girl

Ain't nobody gonna stop us now



C'mon angel my hearts on fire

Don't deny your man's desire

You'd be a fool to stop this tide

Spread your wings and let me come inside



Tonight's the night

It's gonna be alright

Cause I love you girl

Ain't nobody gonna stop us now



Don't say a word my virgin child

Just let your 

inhibitions run wild

The secret is about to unfold

Upstairs before the night's too old



Tonight's the night

It's gonna be alright

Cause I love you girl

Ain't nobody gonna stop us now"
"I made it through the wilderness

Somehow I made it through

Didn't know how lost I was

I'd been had, I was sad and blue

But you made me feel

Yeah, you made me feel

Shiny and new



Like a virgin

Touched for the very first time

Like a virgin

When your heart beats 

Next to mine



Gonna give you all my love, boy

My fear is fading fast

Been saving it all for you

'Cause only love can last



You're so fine and you're mine

Make me strong, yeah you make me bold

Oh your love thawed out

Yeah, your love thawed out

What was scared and cold



Like a virgin

Touched for the very first time

Like a virgin

When your heart beats 

Next to mine



Oooh, oooh, oooh



You're so fine and you're mine

I'll be yours 'till the end of time

'Cause you made me feel

Yeah, you made me feel

I've nothing to hide



Like a virgin

Touched for the very first time

Like a virgin

When your heart beats

Next to mine

Feels so good inside

When you hold me, and you hug me, and you love me

"Everybody loves somebody sometime

Everybody falls in love somehow

Something in your kiss just told me

That sometime is now

Everybody finds somebody someplace

There's no telling whre love may appear

Something in my heart keeps saying

My someplace is here



If I had it in my power

I'd arrange for every girl to have your charms

Then every minute, every hour

Everybody would find what I found in your arms



Everybody loves somebody sometime

And though my dreams were overdue

Your love made it all worth waiting

For someone like you

"You burden me with your questions

You'd have me tell no lies

You're always asking what it's all about

But don't listen to my replies

You say to me I don't talk enough

But when I do I'm a fool

These times I've spent, I've realized

I'm going to shoot through

And leave you



The things, you say

Your purple prose just gives you away

The things, you say

You're unbelievable



You burden me with your problems

By telling me more than mine

I'm always so concerned

With the way you say

You've always go to stop

To think of us being one

Is more than I ever know

But this time, I realize

I'm going to shoot through

And leave you



Seemingly lastless, don't mean

You can ask us

Pushing down the relative

Bringing out your higher self

Think of the fine times

Pushing down the better few

Instead of bringing out the clues

To what the world and everything anger to

Brace yourself with the grace of ease

I know this world ain't what it seems.



What the fuck was that

It's unbelievable"

He got a 32 gun in his pocket full a fun

He got a razor in his shoe



And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown

The baddest man in the whole damn town

Badder than old King Kong

And meaner than a junkyard dog



Well Friday 'bout a week ago

Leroy shootin' dice

And at the edge of the bar

Sat a girl named Doris

And oh that girl looked nice



Well he cast his eyes upon her

And the trouble soon began

And Leroy Brown had learned a lesson

'Bout a-messin' with the wife of a jealous man



And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown

The baddest man in the whole damn town

Badder than a-old King Kong

And meaner than a junkyard dog



Well the two men took to fighting

And when they pulled them from the floor

Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle

With a couple of pieces gone



And it's bad, bad Leroy Brown

The baddest man in the whole damn town

Badder than old King Kong

And meaner than a junkyard dog



And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown

The baddest man in the whole damn town

Badder than old King Kong

And meaner than a junkyard dog



Yeah he was badder than old King Kong

And meaner than a junkyard dog."

To touch your lips and hold you tight, oh

You've got to hold on to romance

Don't let it slide

There's a special kind of magic in the air

When you find another heart that needs to share



Baby, come to me

Let me put my arms around you

This was meant to be

And I'm oh so glad I found you

Need you every day

Gotta have your love around me

Baby, always stay

'Cause I can't go back to livin' without you



Spendin' every dime to keep you talkin' on the line

That's how it was

And all those walks together out in any kind of weather

Just because

There's a brand new way of looking at your life

When you know that love is standing by your side



Baby, come to me

Let me put my arms around you

This was meant to be

And I'm oh so glad I found you

Need you every day

Gotta have your love around me

Baby, always stay

Cause I can't go back to livin' without you



The nights can be cold

There's a chill to every evening when you're all alone

Don't talk anymore

'Cause you know that I'll be here to keep you warm

Oh, darling, keep me warm



Baby, come to me (Come to me)

Let me put my arms around you

This was meant to be

And I'm oh so glad I found you

Need you every day (Every day)

Gotta have your love around me (I gotta have you)

Baby, always stay

'Cause I can't go back to livin' without you

Come to me (Let me put my arms around you)

Let me put my arms around you (Hey!)

This was meant to be

And I'm oh so glad I found you (I need you every day, baby)

Need you every day (Gotta have)

Gotta have your love around me

Baby, always stay (Oh, I want you to stay)

'Cause I can't go back to livin' without you

Come to me (Come to me)

Let me put my arms around you

This was meant to be (Let me love you, baby)

And I'm oh so glad I found you (Glad that I found you)

Need you every day (Got to have you)

Gotta have your love around me

Baby, always stay (Oh, always stay)

'Cause I can't go back to livin' without you"

"Memories
Light the corners of my mind
Misty watercolor memories
Of the way we were
Scattered pictures
Of the smiles we left behind

Smiles we gave to one another

For the way we were



Can it be that it was all so simple then

Or has time rewritten every line

If we had the chance to do it all again

Tell me - Would we? Could we?



Memories

May be beautiful and yet

So much memories

What's too painful to remember

Of the way we were



Can it be that it was all so simple then

Or has time rewritten every line

If we had the chance to do it all again

Tell me - Would we? Could we?



Memories

May be beautiful and yet

Much too painful to remember

We simply choose to forget



So it's the laughter

We will remember

Whenever we remember

The way we were

The way we were

The way we were

The way we were so much baby

I miss the way we were"

"Johnny angel, how I love him

He's got something I can't resist

But he doesn't even know that I exist

Johnny angel, how I want him

How I tingle when he passes by

Every time he says hello, my heart begins to fly



I remember how I get carried away

I dream of him and me, and how it's gonna be



Other fellas call me up for a date

But I just sit and wait

I'd rather concentrate on



...Johnny Angel

'Cause I love him

And I pray that someday he'll love me

And together we will see how lovely heaven will be"
"I need love, love

To ease my mind

I need to find, find someone call mine

But mama said

You can't hurry love

No, you just have to wait

She said love don't come easy

It's a game of give and take



You can't hurry love

No, you just have to wait

You got to trust, give it time

No matter how long it takes



But how many heartaches

Must I stand before I find a love

To let me live again

Right now the only thing

That keeps me hangin' on

When I feel my strength, yeah

It's almost gone

I remember mama said



You can't hurry love

No, you just have to wait

She said love don't come easy

It's a game of give and take



How long must I wait

How much more can I take

Before loneliness will cause my heart

Heart to break?



No I can't bear to live my life alone

I grow impatient for a love to call my own

But when I feel that I, I can't go on

These precious words keeps me hangin' on

I remember mama said



You can't hurry love

No, you just have to wait

She said love don't come easy

It's a game of give and take



You can't hurry love

No, you just have to wait

She said trust, give it time

No matter how long it takes



No, love, love, don't come easy

But I keep on waiting

Anticipating for that soft voice

To talk to me at night

For some tender arms

To hold me tight

I keep waiting

I keep on waiting

But it ain't easy

It ain't easy

But mama said



You can't hurry love

No, you just have to wait

She said to trust, give it time

No matter how long it takes



You can't hurry love

No, you just have to wait

She said love don't come easy

It's a game of give and take"
"Goodbye to you my trusted friend

We've known each other since we were nine or ten

Together we've climbed hills and trees

Learned of love and A B C's

Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees.

Goodbye my friend it's hard to die

When all the birds are singing in the sky

Now that the spring is in the air

Pretty girls are everywhere

Think of me and I'll be there



We had joy we had fun

We had seasons in the sun

But the hills that we climbed were just seasons

Out of time......



Goodbye Papa please pray for me

I was the black sheep of the family

You tried to teach me right from wrong

Too much wine and too much song

Wonder how I got along.



Goodbye Papa its hard to die

When all the birds are singing in the sky

Now that the spring is in the air

Little children everywhere

When you see them I'll be there.



We had joy we had fun

We had seasons in the sun

But the wine and the song like the seasons

Have all gone.



We had joy we had fun

We had seasons in the sun

But the wine and the song like the seasons

Have all gone.



Goodbye Michelle my little one

You gave me love and helped me find the sun

And every time that I was down

You would always come around

And get my feet back on the ground.



Goodbye Michelle it's hard to die

When all the birds are singing in the sky

Now that the spring is in the air

With the flowers everywhere

I wish that we could both be there



We had joy we had fun

We had seasons in the sun

But the stars we could reach

Were just starfish on the beach



We had joy we had fun

We had seasons in the sun

But the stars we could reach

Were just starfish on the beach



We had joy we had fun

We had seasons in the sun

But the wine and the song like the seasons

Have all gone



All our lives we had fun

We had seasons in the sun

But the wine and the song like the sesons have all gone



All our lives we had had fun

We had sesons in the sun

but the hill that we climbed were just seasons out of time

"Don't go breaking my heart

I couldn't if I tried

Honey if I get restless

Baby you're not that kind

Don't go breaking my heart

You take the weight off me

Honey when you knock on my door

I gave you my key



Nobody knows it

When I was down

I was your clown

Nobody knows it

Right from the start

I gave you my heart

I gave you my heart



So don't go breaking my heart

I won't go breaking your heart

Don't go breaking my heart



And nobody told us

`Cause nobody showed us

And now it's up to us babe

I think we can make it



So don't misunderstand me

You put the light in my life

You put the sparks to the flame

I've got your heart in my sights"
"There's a summer place
Where it may rain or storm
Yet I'm safe and warm
For within that summer place
Your arms reach out to me
And my heart is free from all care

For it knows



There are no gloomy skies

When seen through the eyes

Of those who are blessed with love



And the sweet secret of

A summer place

Is that it's anywhere

When two people share

All their hopes

All their dreams

All their love



There's a summer place

Where it may rain or storm

Yet I'm safe and warm

In your arms, in your arms

In your arms, in your arms

In your arms, in your arms"
"I walk a lonely road

The only one that I have ever known

Don't know where it goes

But it's home to me and I walk alone

I walk this empty street

On the Boulevard of broken dreams

Where the city sleeps

And I'm the only one and I walk alone



I walk alone

I walk alone



I walk alone

I walk a.....



My shadow's the only one that walks beside me

My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating

Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me

Till then I walk alone



Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aah-ah

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah



I'm walking down the line

That divides me somewhere in my mind

On the border line of the edge

And where I walk alone



Read between the lines

What's fucked up and everything's all right

Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive

And I walk alone



I walk alone

I walk alone



I walk alone

I walk a...



My shadow's the only one that walks beside me

My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating

Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me

Till then I walk alone



Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aah-ah

Ah-ah, ah-ah

"Oh, my, god. Becky, look at her butt.

It is so big. *scoff* She looks like,

one of those rap guys' girlfriends.

But, y'know, who understands those rap guys? *scoff*

They only talk to her, because,

she looks like a total prostitute, 'kay?

I mean, her butt, is just so big. *scoff*

I can't believe it's just so round, it's like,

out there, I mean - gross. Look!

She's just so ... black!



I like big butts and I can not lie

You other brothers can't deny

That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist

And a round thing in your face

You get sprung, wanna pull out your tough

'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed

Deep in the jeans she's wearing

I'm hooked and I can't stop staring

Oh baby, I wanna get wit'cha

And take your picture

My homeboys tried to warn me

But with that butt you got makes me feel so horny

Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin

You say you wanna get in my Benz?

Well, use me, use me

'Cause you ain't that average groupy

I've seen them dancin'

The hell with romancin'

She's sweat, wet,

Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette

I'm tired of magazines

Sayin' flat butts are the thing

Take the average black man and ask him that

She gotta pack much back

I ain't talkin' bout Playboy

'Cause silicone parts are made for toys

I want 'em real thick and juicy

So find that juicy double

Mix-a-Lot's in trouble

Beggin' for a piece of that bubble

So I'm lookin' at rock videos

Knock-kneeded bimbos walkin' like hoes

You can have them bimbos

I'll keep my women like Flo Jo

A word to the thick soul sistas, I wanna get with ya

I won't cuss or hit ya

But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *fuck*

Til the break of dawn

Baby got it goin' on

A lot of simps won't like this song

'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it

And I'd rather stay and play

'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong

And I'm down to get the friction on

So, ladies! {Yeah!} Ladies! {Yeah}

If you wanna role in my Mercedes {Yeah!}

Then turn around! Stick it out!

Even white boys got to shout

Baby got back!

to do with my selection. 36-24-36? Ha ha, only if she's 5'3\"".



So your girlfriend rolls a Honda, playin' workout tapes by Fonda

But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda

My anaconda don't want none

Unless you've got buns, hun

You can do side bends or sit-ups,

But please don't lose that butt

Some brothers wanna play that \""hard\"" role

And tell you that the butt ain't gold

So they toss it and leave it

And I pull up quick to retrieve it

So Cosmo says you're fat

Well I ain't down with that!

'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'

And I'm thinkin' bout stickin'

To the beanpole dames in the magazines:

You ain't it, Miss Thing!

Give me a sista, I can't resist her

Red beans and rice didn't miss her

Some knucklehead tried to dis

'Cause his girls are on my list

He had game but he chose to hit 'em

And I pull up quick to get wit 'em

So ladies, if the butt is round,

And you want a triple X throw down,

Dial 1-900-MIXALOT

And kick them nasty thoughts

"Jessie is a friend,

Yeah I know he's been a good friend of mine

But lately something's changed

It ain't hard to define

Jessie's got himself a girl

And I want to make her mine

And she's watching him with those eyes

And she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it!

And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night



You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl

I wish that I had Jessie's girl

Where can I find her, a woman like that?



I'll play along with this charade

That doesn't seem to be a reason to change

You know I feel so dirty when they start talking cute

I wanna tell her that I love but the point is probably moot

'Cause she's watching him with those eyes

And she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it!

And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night



You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl

I wish that I had Jessie's girl

Where can I find her, a woman like that?



Like Jessie's girl

I wish that I had Jessie's girl

Where can I find her, a woman...

Where can I find her, a woman like that?



And I'm lookin' in the mirror all the time

Wonderin' what she don't see in me

I've been funny; I've been cool with the lines

Ain't that the way love's supposed to be?

Tell me why can't I find a woman like that?



You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl

I wish that I had Jessie's girl

Where can I find her, a woman like that?



Like Jessie's girl

I wish that I had Jessie's girl

I want, I want Jessie's girl"
"As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left 
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long, that 
Even my mama thinks that my mind is gone 
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it 
Me be treated like a punk you know that's unheard of 

You better watch how you're talking, and where you're walking 

Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk 

I really hate to trip but i gotta loc 

As I Grow I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool 

I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like 

on my knees in the night, saying prayers in the streetlight. 

Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Keep spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Keep spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 



The getto situation, they got me facin' 

I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the stripes 

So I gotta be down with the hood team 

Too much television watching got me chasing dreams 

I'm an educated fool with money on my mind 

Got my tin in my hand and a gleam in my eye 

I'm a loc'd out gangsta set trippin' banger 

And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger, fool 

Death ain't nothing but a heartbeat away, 

I'm living life, do or die, what can I say 

I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24 

The way things are going I don't know 



Tell me why are we, so blind to see 

That the one's we hurt, are you and me 

Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Power and the money, money and the power 

Minute after minute, hour after hour 

Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking 

What's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin' 

They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me 

If they can't undersstand it, how can they reach me 

I guess they can't, I guess they won't 

I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool 



Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Tell me why are we, so blind to see 

That the one's we hurt, are you and me 

Tell me why are we, so blind to see 

That the one's we hurt, are you and me 

(fade out)"
"[1st Verse]

She Was More Like A Beauty Queen From A Movie Scene

I Said Don't Mind, But What Do You Mean I Am The One

Who Will Dance On The Floor In The Round

She Said I Am The One Who Will Dance On The Floor In The Round

[2nd Verse]

She Told Me Her Name Was Billie Jean, As She Caused A Scene

Then Every Head Turned With Eyes That Dreamed Of Being The One

Who Will Dance On The Floor In The Round



[Bridge]

People Always Told Me Be Careful Of What You Do

And Don't Go Around Breaking Young Girls' Hearts

And Mother Always Told Me Be Careful Of Who You Love

And Be Careful Of What You Do 'Cause The Lie Becomes The Truth



[Chorus]

Billie Jean Is Not My Lover

She's Just A Girl Who Claims That I Am The One

But The Kid Is Not My Son

She Says I Am The One, But The Kid Is Not My Son



[3rd Verse]

For Forty Days And Forty Nights

The Law Was On Her Side

But Who Can Stand When She's In Demand

Her Schemes And Plans

'Cause We Danced On The Floor In The Round

So Take My Strong Advice, Just Remember To Always Think Twice

(Do Think Twice)



[4th Verse]

She Told My Baby We'd Danced 'Till Three

Then She Looked At Me

Then Showed A Photo My Baby Cried

His Eyes Looked Like Mine

Go On Dance On The Floor In The Round, Baby



[Bridge]

People Always Told Me Be Careful Of What You Do

And Don't Go Around Breaking Young Girls' Hearts

She Came And Stood Right By Me

Then The Smell Of Sweet Perfume

This Happened Much Too Soon

She Called Me To Her Room



[Chorus]

Billie Jean Is Not My Lover

She's Just A Girl Who Claims That I Am The One

But The Kid Is Not My Son

Billie Jean Is Not My Lover

She's Just A Girl Who Claims That I Am The One

But The Kid Is Not My Son

She Says I Am The One, But The Kid Is Not My Son

She Says I Am The One, But The Kid Is Not My Son

Billie Jean Is Not My Lover

She's Just A Girl Who Claims That I Am The One

But The Kid Is Not My Son

She Says I Am The One, But The Kid Is Not My Son

She Says I Am The One, She Says He Is My Son

She Says I Am The One

Billie Jean Is Not My Lover

Billie Jean Is Not My Lover

Billie Jean Is Not My Lover

Billie Jean Is Not My Lover

"Oh yeah, I'll tell you something,

I think you'll understand.

When I'll say that something

I want to hold your hand 
I want to hold your hand 
I want to hold your hand 



Oh please, say to me

You'll let me be your man

And please, say to me

You'll let me hold your hand.

Now let me hold your hand,

I want to hold your hand.



And when I touch you I feel happy inside.

It's such a feeling that my love

I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide.



Yeah, you've got that something,

I think you'll understand.

When I'll say that something

I want to hold your hand,

I want to hold your hand,

I want to hold your hand.



And when I touch you I feel happy inside.

It's such a feeling that my love

I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide.

"Last night we let the liquor talk

I can't remember everything we said but we said it all

You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met

But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet

No way it was our last night

I kiss your lips

Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips

Last bottle of Jack we split a fifth

Just talk about life goin' sip for sip

You, you know you love to fight

And I say shit I don't mean

But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me



I know that last night we let the liquor talk

I can't remember everything we said but we said it all

You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met

But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet

No way it was our last night

No way it was our last night



No way it was the last night that we break up

I see your tail lights in the dust

You call your momma, I call your bluff

In the middle of the night, pull it right back up

Yeah my, my friends say let her go

Your friends say what the hell

I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else



Oh baby, last night we let the liquor talk

I can't remember everything we said but we said it all

You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met

But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet



No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough

I can’t remember everything we said but we said too much

I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left

But baby, baby somethin’s tellin’ me this ain’t over yet

No way it was our last night

No way it was our last night



I know you said this time you really weren’t coming back again

But baby, baby somethin’s tellin’ me this ain’t over yet

No way it was our last night

No way it was our last night"
"When your legs don't work like they used to before

And I can't sweep you off of your feet

Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?

Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And darling I will be loving you till we're 70

And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23

And I'm thinking about how



People fall in love in mysterious ways

Maybe just a touch of a hand

Well me I fall in love with you every single day

And I just wanna tell you I am



So honey now, take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud

And maybe we found love right where we are



When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades

And the crowds don't remember my name

When my hands don't play the strings the same way

I know you will still love me the same

Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen

And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory

And I'm thinking about how



People fall in love in mysterious ways

And maybe it's all part of a plan

I'll just keep on making the same mistakes

Hoping that you'll understand



But baby now, take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud

And maybe we found love right where we are



So baby now, take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, oh darling

Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud

That maybe we found love right where we are

And baby we found love right where we are

And we found love right where we are"
"You say I only hear what I want to 
And you say I talk so all the time-so 

And I thought what I felt was simple
And I thought that I don't belong
And now that I am leaving

Now I know that I did something wrong cause I missed you

Yeah, I missed you



And you say I only hear what I want to

I don't listen hard

I don't pay attention to the distance that you're running or to

Anyone, anywhere

I don't understand if you really care

I'm only hearing negative, no no no - bad



So I turned the radio on I turned the radio up

And this woman was singing my song

The lover's in love and the other's run away

The lover is crying cause the other won't stay

And some of us hover when we weep for the other who

was dying

Since the day they were born well

Well this is not that

I think that I'm throwing but I'm thrown



And I thought I'd live forever but now I'm not so sure

You try to tell me that I'm clever but that won't take me anyhow

Or anywhere with you 



And you said that I was naive

And I thought that I was strong

I thought \""hey I can leave, I can leave\""

But now I know that I was wrong cause I missed you

Yeah I missed you



You said \""you caught me cause you want me 

And one day I'll let you go\""

You try to give away a keeper or keep me cause you're know

you're

just too scared to lose



And you say, \""stay\"" 

You say I only hear what I want to."

Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone

Let's pretend that we're together all alone

I'll tell the man to turn the juke box way down low

And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go



Whisper to me tell me do you love me true

Or is he holding you the way I do

Though love is blind make up your mind I've got to know

Should I hang up or will you tell him he'll have to go



You can't say the words I want to hear

While you're with another man

Do you want me answer yes or no

Darlin' I will understand



Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone

Let's pretend that we're together all alone

I'll tell the man to turn the juke box way down low

And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go"

Then love died, now the rainbow is gone

Longing for you so lost and alone"
"Hello, everyone, this is your action news reporter with all the news that is news across the nation, on the scene at the supermarket.

There seems to have been some disturbance here. Pardon me, sir, did you see what happened?

Yeah, I did. I's standin' overe there by the tomaters, and here he come, running through the pole beans, through the fruits and vegetables, nekkid as a jay bird.

And I hollered over t' Ethel, I said, \""Don't look, Ethel!\"" But it's too late, she'd already been incensed.

Here he comes, look at that, look at that

There he goes, look at that, look at that

And he ain't wearin' no clothes



Oh yes, they call him the Streak

(Look at that, look at that)

Fastest thing on two feet

(Look at that, look at that)

He's just as proud as he can be

Of his anatomy

He goin' give us a peek



Oh, yes, they call him the Streak

(Look at that, look at that)

He likes to show off his physique

(Look at that, look at that)

If there's an audience to be found

He'll be streakin' around

Invitin' public critique



This is your action news reporter once again and we're here at the gas station. Pardon me, sir, did you see what happened?



Yeah, I did. I's just in here gettin my car checked, he just appeared out of the traffic.

Come streakin' around the grease rack there, didn't have nothin' on but a smile.

I looked in there, and Ethel was gettin' her a cold drink.

I hollered, \""Don't look, Ethel!\"" But it was too late.

She'd already been mooned. Flashed her right there in front of the shock absorbers.



He ain't crude, look at that, look at that

He ain't lewd, look at that, look at that

He's just in the mood to run in the nude



Oh, yes, they call him the Streak

(Look at that, look at that)

He likes to turn the other cheek

(Look at that, look at that)

He's always makin' the news

Wearin' just his tennis shoes

Guess you could call him unique



Once again, your action news reporter in the booth at the gym, covering the disturbance at the basketball playoff.

Pardon me, sir, did you see what happened?



Yeah, I did. Half time, I's just goin' down thar to get Ethel a snow cone.

And here he come, right out of the cheap seats, dribbling, right down the middle of the court.

Didn't have on nothing but his PF's. Made a hook shot and got out through the concessions stand.

I hollered up at Ethel, I said, \""Don't look, Ethel!\""

But it was too late. She'd already got a free shot.

Grandstandin', right there in front of the home team.



Oh, yes, they call him the Streak

(Look at that, look at that)

The fastest thing on two feet

(Look at that, look at that)

He's just as proud as he can be

Of his anatomy

He's gonna give us a peek

Who's that with him?

Ethel? Is that you, Ethel?

"I'm only pretty sure that I can't take anymore,

Before you take a swing,

I wonder

What are we fighting for?

When I say out loud,

I want to get out of this,

I wonder

Is there anything

I'm going to miss,

I wonder how's it going to be,

When you don't know me,

How's it going to be,

When you're sure I'm not there,

How's it going to be,

When there is no one there to talk about,

How's it going to be,

'Cause I don't care,

How's it going to be,



Where we used to laugh,

There's a shouting match,

Sharp as a thumbnail scratch,

A silence I can't ignore,

Like...

The hammocks and the doorways we spent time in,

Swing empty,

Don't see lightning like last fall

When it was always about to hit me,

I guess that's how it's going to be

Want to get back in again

The soft dive of oblivion"
"Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waiting for a train
And I am feeling near as faded as my jeans.
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained,
It rode us all the way to New Orleans.
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna,
I was playing soft while Bobby sang the blues.
Windshield wipers slapping time, I was holding Bobby?s hand in mine,
We sang every song that driver knew.
Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose,
Nothing don?t mean nothing honey if it ain?t free, now now.
And feeling good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues,
You know feeling good was good enough for me,
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee.
From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun,
Hey, Bobby shared the secrets of my soul.
Through all kinds of weather, through everything that we done,
Hey Bobby baby kept me from the cold.
One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away,
He?s looking for that home and I hope he finds it,
But I?d trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday
To be holding Bobby?s body next to mine.
Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose,
Nothing, that?s all that Bobby left me, yeah,
But feeling good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues,
Hey, feeling good was good enough for me, hmm hmm,
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee.
La la la, la la la la, la la la, la la la la
La la la la la Bobby McGee.
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, Bobby McGee, la.
La La la, la la la la la la,
La La la la la la la la la, hey now Bobby now Bobby McGee yeah.
Na na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na na na na
Hey now Bobby now, Bobby McGee, yeah.
Lord, I?m calling my lover, calling my man,
I said I?m calling my lover just the best I can,
C?mon, where is Bobby now, where is Bobby McGee, yeah,
Lordy Lordy Lordy Lordy Lordy Lordy Lordy Lord
Hey, hey, hey, Bobby McGee, Lord!
Yeah! Whew!
Lordy Lordy Lordy Lordy Lordy Lordy Lordy Lord
Hey, hey, hey, Bobby McGee."

"Hello, it's me

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet

To go over everything

They say that time's supposed to heal ya

But I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be

When we were younger and free

I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet



There's such a difference between us

And a million miles



Hello from the other side

I must've called a thousand times 

To tell you I'm sorry

For everything that I've done

But when I call you never 

Seem to be home



Hello from the outside

At least I can say that I've tried 

To tell you I'm sorry

For breaking your heart

But it don't matter, it clearly 

Doesn't tear you apart anymore



Hello, how are you?

It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry 

I hope that you're well

Did you ever make it out of that town

Where nothing ever happened?



It's no secret

That the both of us 

Are running out of time



So hello from the other side (other side)

I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)

To tell you I'm sorry

For everything that I've done

But when I call you never 

Seem to be home



Hello from the outside (outside)

At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)

To tell you I'm sorry

For breaking your heart

But it don't matter, it clearly 

Doesn't tear you apart anymore



Ooooohh, anymore

Ooooohh, anymore

Ooooohh, anymore

Anymore



Hello from the other side (other side)

I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)

To tell you I'm sorry

For everything that I've done

But when I call you never 

Seem to be home



Hello from the outside (outside)

At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)

To tell you I'm sorry

For breaking your heart

But it don't matter, it clearly 

Doesn't tear you apart anymore"

right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink cause she can't shoot whiskey...

Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick, showing her how to shoot a combo...

And he don't know...



That I dug my key into the side of his pretty little suped up 4 wheel drive,

carved my name into his leather seats...

I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights,

slashed a hole in all 4 tires...



Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats.



Right now, she's probably up singing some

white-trash version of Shania karoke..

Right now, she's probably saying \""I'm drunk\""

and he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky,

Right now, he's probably dabbing on 3 dollars worth of that bathroom polo...

I might saved a little trouble for the next girl,

Cause the next time that he cheats...



Oh, you know it won't be on me!



Ohh... not on me...

"Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show

I laced the track, you locked the flow

So far from hangin' on the block for dough

Notorious, they got to know that

Life ain't always what it seem to be

Words can't express what you mean to me

Even though you're gone, we still a team

Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream, that's right

In the future, can't wait to see

If you open up the gates for me

Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend

Try to black it out, but it plays again

When it's real, feelings hard to conceal

Can't imagine all the pain I feel

Give anythin' to hear half your breath, half your breath

I know you still livin' your life, after death



Every step I take, every move I make

Every single day, every time I pray

I'll be missing you

Thinkin' of the day, when you went away

What a life to take, what a bond to break

I'll be missin' you



It's kinda hard with you not around

Know you in heaven smilin' down

Watchin' us while we pray for you

Every day we pray for you

'til the day we meet again

In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend

Memories give me the strength I need to proceed

Strength I need to believe

My thoughts Big I just can't define

Wish I could turn back the hands of time

Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks

You and me takin' flicks

Makin' hits, stages they receive you on

Still can't believe you're gone

Give anything to hear half your breath

I know you still livin' your life, after death



Every step I take, every move I make

Every single day, every time I pray

I'll be missing you

Thinkin' of the day, when you went away

What a life to take, what a bond to break

I'll be missin' you



Somebody tell me why

One black morning

When this life is over

I know

I'll see your face



Every night I pray, every step I take

Every move I make, every single day

Every night I pray, every step I take

Every day that passes

Every move I make, every single day

Is a day that I get closer

To seeing you again

Every night I pray, every step I take

We miss you B.I.G., and we won't stop

Every move I make, every single day

Cause we can't stop... that's right

Every night I pray, every step I take

Every move I make, every single day

We miss you B.I.G"
"[iTunes Bonus Track]

I had a way then losing it all on my own

I had a heart then but the queen has been overthrown

And I'm not sleeping now the dark is too hard to beat

And I'm not keeping now the strength I need to push me



You show the lights that stop me turn to stone

You shine It when I'm alone

And so I tell myself that I'll be strong

And dreaming when they're gone



'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home

Calling, calling, calling home

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone

You shine It when I'm alone



Home



Noises, I play within my head

Touch my own skin and hope that I'm still breathing

And I think back to when my brother and my sister slept

In an unlocked place the only time I feel safe



You show the lights that stop me turn to stone

You shine it when I'm alone

And so I tell myself that I'll be strong

And dreaming when they're gone



'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home

Calling, calling, calling home

You tell me your life's been way off line 

You're falling to pieces everytime 

And I don't need no carryin' on

You're taking one down 

You sing a sad song just to turn it around

You're coming back down and you really don't mind

Shift your arm, then you pull it back

"Time can never mend the careless whispers, of a good friend

To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind

There's no comfort in the truth 
Pain is all you'll find

Should've known better



I feel so unsure

As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor

As the music dies, something in your eyes

Calls to mind the silver screen

And all its sad good-byes



I'm never gonna dance again

Guilty feet have got no rhythm

Though it's easy to pretend

I know your not a fool



Should've known better than to cheat a friend

And waste the chance that I've been given

So I'm never gonna dance again

The way I danced with you



Time can never mend

The careless whispers of a good friend

To the heart and mind

Ignorance is kind

There's no comfort in the truth

Pain is all you'll find



I'm never gonna dance again

Guilty feet have got no rhythm

Though it's easy to pretend

I know your not a fool



Should've known better than to cheat a friend

And waste this chance that I've been given

So I'm never gonna dance again

The way I danced with you



Never without your love



Tonight the music seems so loud

I wish that we could lose this crowd

Maybe it's better this way

We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say



We could have been so good together

We could have lived this dance forever

But no one's gonna dance with me

Please stay



And I'm never gonna dance again

Guilty feet have got no rhythm 

Though it's easy to pretend

I know your not a fool



Should've known better than to cheat a friend

And waste the chance that I've been given

So I'm never gonna dance again

"As I walk this land with broken dreams

I have visions of many things

Love's happiness is just an illusion

Filled with sadness and confusion.

What becomes of the brokenhearted

Who had love that's now departed?

I know I've got to find

Some kind of peace of mind, maybe



The fruits of love grow all around

But for me they come a-tumblin' down.

Every day heartaches grow a little stronger

I can't stand this pain much longer



I walk in shadows searching for light

Cold and alone, no comfort in sight,

Hoping and praying for someone to care

Always moving and going nowhere



What becomes of the brokenhearted

Who had love that's now departed?

I know I've got to find

Some kind of peace of mind, maybe



I'm searching though I don't succeed,

But someone look, there's a growing need.

Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning,

All that's left is an unhappy ending.

Now what's become of the broken-hearted

Who had love that's now departed?

I know I've got to find

Some kind of peace of mind

I'll be searching everywhere

Just to find someone to care.

I'll be looking every day

I know I'm gonna find a way

Nothing's gonna stop me now

I will find a way somehow



(What's become, what's become,

What's become of the brokenhearted

What's become, what's become,

What's become of the brokenhearted)



I knooow, ohh yeah...."
"Dig if U will the picture 
Of U and I engaged in a kiss 
The sweat of your body covers me 
Can U my darling 
Can U picture this? 


Dream if U can a courtyard 

An ocean of violets in bloom 

Animals strike curious poses 

They feel the heat 

The heat between me and U 



How can U just leave me standing 

Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold) 

Maybe I'm just 2 demanding 

Maybe I'm just like my father - 2 bold 

Maybe U're just like my mother 

She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied) 

Why do we scream at each other? 

This is what it sounds like when doves cry 



Touch if U will my stomach 

Feel how it trembles inside 

U've got the butterflies all tied up 

Don't make me chase U 

Even doves have pride 



How could U just leave me standing 

Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold) 

Maybe I'm just 2 demanding 

Maybe I'm just like my father - 2 bold 

Maybe U're just like my mother 

She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied) 

Why do we scream at each other? 

This is what it sounds like when doves cry 



How can U just leave me standing 

Alone in a world that's so cold? (A world that's so cold) 

Maybe I'm just 2 demanding (Maybe, maybe I'm like my father) 

Maybe I'm just like my father - 2 bold (U know, U know he's 2 bold) 

Maybe U're just like my mother (Maybe U're just like my mother) 

She's never satisfied (She's never, never satisfied) 

Why do we scream at each other? (Why do we scream? Why?) 

This is what it sounds like when doves cry 

When doves cry (When doves cry) (When doves cry) {x2} 

Don't cry (Don't cry) 



Oh yeah {x6} 

When doves cry {x3} 

Babe! {x6} 



When doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry, doves cry) 

When?when? 

Don't cry 

Darling, don't cry 

Don't cry, don't cry, don't, don't cry"
"Hello, Dolly,
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell, Dolly
I can tell, Dolly
You're still glowin', you're still crowin'
You're still goin' strong
We feel the room swayin'
While the band's playin'
One of your old favourite songs from way back when
So, take her wrap, fellas
Find her an empty lap, fellas
Dolly'll never go away again
Hello, Dolly,
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong

Golly, gee, fellas
Find her a vacant knee, fellas
Dolly'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away again"
"(I can't stop loving you)

I've made up my mind

To live in memory of the lonesome times

(I can't stop wanting you)

It's useless to say

So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday

(Dreams of yesterday)

Those happy hours that we once knew

Tho' long ago, they still make me blue

They say that time heals a broken heart

But time has stood still since we've been apart



(I can't stop loving you)

I've made up my mind

To live in memories of the lonesome times

Those happy hours

(That we once knew)

That we once knew

(Tho' long ago)

Tho' long ago

(Still make me blue)

Still ma-a-a-ake me blue

(They say that time)

They say that time

(Heals a broken heart)

Heals a broken heart

(But time has stood still)

Time has stood still

(Since we've been apart)

Since we've been apart



(I can't stop loving you)

I said I made up my mind

To live in memory of the lonesome times

(Sing a song, children)

(I can't stop wanting you)

It's useless to say

So I'll just live my life of dreams of yesterday

(Of yesterday)"
"The club isn't the best place to find a lover so the bar is where I go

Me and my friends at the table doing shots

Drinking fast and then we talk slow

Come over and start up a conversation with just me 
And trust me I'll give it a chance now

Take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox

And then we start to dance and now I'm singing like



Girl, you know I want your love

Your love was handmade for somebody like me

Come on now, follow my lead

I may be crazy, don't mind me

Say, boy, let's not talk too much

Grab on my waist and put that body on me

Come on now, follow my lead

Come, come on now, follow my lead



I'm in love with the shape of you

We push and pull like a magnet do

Although my heart is falling too

I'm in love with your body

And last night you were in my room

And now my bedsheets smell like you

Every day discovering something brand new

I'm in love with your body (Ohiohiohiohi)

I'm in love with your body (Ohiohiohiohi)

I'm in love with your body (Ohiohiohiohi)

I'm in love with your body

Every day discovering something brand new

I'm in love with the shape of you



One week in we let the story begin, we're going out on our first date

You and me are thrifty so go all you can eat

Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour

And how your family is doing okay

Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat

Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singing like



Girl, you know I want your love

Your love was handmade for somebody like me

Come on now, follow my lead

I may be crazy, don't mind me

Say, boy, let's not talk too much

Grab on my waist and put that body on me

Come on now, follow my lead

Come, come on now, follow my lead



I'm in love with the shape of you

We push and pull like a magnet do

Although my heart is falling too

I'm in love with your body

And last night you were in my room

And now my bedsheets smell like you

Every day discovering something brand new

I'm in love with your body (Ohiohiohiohi)

I'm in love with your body (Ohiohiohiohi)

I'm in love with your body (Ohiohiohiohi)

I'm in love with your body

Every day discovering something brand new

I'm in love with the shape of you



Come on, be my baby, come on

Come on, be my baby, come on

Come on, be my baby, come on

Come on, be my baby, come on

Come on, be my baby, come on

Come on, be my baby, come on

"I met a gin-soaked bar-room queen in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride
She had to heave me right across her shoulder
'Cause I just can't seem to drink you off my mind

It's the honky tonk women

Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues



I laid a divorcée in New York City

I had to put up some kind of a fight

The lady then she covered me in roses

She blew my nose and then she blew my mind



It's the honky tonk women

Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

All right



It's the honky tonk women

That gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues



It's the honky tonk women

Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues"

"Desperate for changing

Starving for truth

I'm closer to where I started

Chasing after you

I'm falling even more in love with you

Letting go of all I've held on to

I'm standing here until you make me move

I'm hangin by a moment here with you



Forgetting all I'm lacking

Completely incomplete

I'll take your invitation

You take all of me now



I'm falling even more in love with you

Letting go of all I've held on to

I'm standing here until you make me move

I'm hanging by a moment here with you

I'm living for the only thing I know

I'm running and not quite sure where to go

And I don't know what I'm diving in to

I'm hanging by a moment here with you



There's nothing else to lose

There's nothing else to find

There's nothing in the world

That could change my mind

There is nothing else...



Desperate for changing

Starving for truth

I'm closer to where I started

Chasing after you

I'm falling more in love with you

Letting go of all I've held on to

I'm standing here until you make me move

I'm hanging by a moment here with you"

"So open up your morning light 
And say a little prayer for I 
You know that if we are to stay alive 
And see the peace in every eye

She had two babies 

One was six months one was three 

In the war of '44 

Every telephone ring 

Every heartbeat stinging 

When she thought it was God calling her 

Oh would her son grow to know his father 



I don't want to wait 

For our lives to be over 

I want to know right now 

What will it be 

I don't want to wait 

For our lives to be over 

Will it be yes or will it be... sorry?



He showed up all wet

On the rainy front step

Wearing shrapnel in his skin

And the war he saw

Lives inside him still! 

It's so hard to be gentle, and warm

The years passed by and now 

He has granddaughters



I don't want to wait 

For our lives to be over 

I want to know right now 

What will it be 

I don't want to wait 

For our lives to be over 

Will it be yes or will it be...



Ohhh! So you look at me...

From across the room!

You're wearing your anguish again!

Believe me! I know the feeling...

It sucks you Into the jaws of anger!

Ohhh! So I dig a little more deeply... [into my life!]

All we have is this very moment!

And I don't want to do what 

His father and his father and his father did 

I want to be here now 



So open up your morning light

And say a little prayer for I

You know that if we are to stay alive

And see the peace in every eye



I don't want to wait 

For our lives to be over 

I want to know right now 

What will it be 

I don't want to wait 

For our lives to be over 

Will it be yes or will it be...



I don't want to wait 

For our lives to be over 

I want to know right now 

What will it be 

I don't want to wait 

For our lives to be over 

Will it be yes or will it be... sorry?



So open up your morning light

And say a little prayer for I

You know that if we are to stay alive

And see the love in every eye"
"(feat. Aaron Hall, Bernard Bill, Lee Drakeford, ...)

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me 
Why don't they just let me live? 
I don't need commission, make my own decisions 
That's my prerogative 



They say I'm crazy 

I really don't care 

That's my prerogative 

They say I'm nasty 

But I don't give a damn 

Getting girls is how I live 

Some messy questions 

Why am I so real? 

But they don't undersand me 

I really don't know the deal about her brother 

Trying hard to make it right 

Not long ago 

Before I win this fight, sing 



[Chorus:]

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me 

Why don't they just let me live? 

Tell me why I don't need commission 

Make my own decisions 

That's my prerogative 

It's my prerogative (it's my prerogative) 



It's the way that I wanna live (it's my prerogative) 

I can do just what I feel (it's my prerogative) 

No one can tell me what to do (it's my prerogative) 

'Cause what I'm doing I'm doing for you 



Don't get me wrong 

I'm really not souped 

Ego trips is not my thing 

All these strange relationships really gets me down 

I see nothing wrong in spreading myself around 



[Chorus]



I can do what I wanna do (it's my prerogative) 

I can live my life (it's my prerogative) 

And I'm doing it just for you (it's my prerogative) 



Tell me, tell me why can't I live my life 

Live my life without all of the things 

That people say oh 



Yo, teddy kick it like this 

Oh no no I can do what I wanna do 

Me and you together together together together together

What's it like in New York City?

I'm a thousand miles away

But girl, tonight you look so pretty

Yes you do

Times Square can't shine as bright as you

I swear it's true



Hey there Delilah

Don't you worry about the distance

I'm right there if you get lonely

Give this song another listen

Close your eyes

Listen to my voice, it's my disguise

I'm by your side



Oh it's what you do to me

Oh it's what you do to me

Oh it's what you do to me

Oh it's what you do to me

What you do to me



Hey there Delilah

I know times are getting hard

But just believe me, girl

Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar

We'll have it good

We'll have the life we knew we would

My word is good



Hey there Delilah

I've got so much left to say

If every simple song I wrote to you

Would take your breath away

I'd write it all

Even more in love with me you'd fall

We'd have it all



Oh it's what you do to me

Oh it's what you do to me

Oh it's what you do to me

Oh it's what you do to me



A thousand miles seem pretty far

But they've got planes and trains and cars

I'd walk to you if I had no other way

Our friends would all make fun of us

and we'll just laugh along because 

We know that none of them have felt this way

Delilah I can promise you

That by the time we get through

The world will never ever be the same

And you're to blame



Hey there Delilah

You be good and don't you miss me

Two more years and you'll be done with school 

And I'll be making history like I do

You'll know it's all because of you

We can do whatever we want to

Hey there Delilah here's to you

This one's for you



Oh it's what you do to me

Oh it's what you do to me

Oh it's what you do to me

Oh it's what you do to me

What you do to me"

And decided to create a dream come true

So they sprinkled moondust in your hair of gold

And starlight in your eyes of blue

"Ohhhh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh.

It must have been cold there in my shadow,

to never have sunlight on your face.

You were content to let me shine, that's your way.

You always walked a step behind.

So I was the one with all the glory,

while you were the one with all the strength.

A beautiful face without a name for so long.

A beautiful smile to hide the pain.



Did you ever know that you're my hero,

and everything I would like to be?

I can fly higher than an eagle,

for you are the wind beneath my wings.



It might have appeared to go unnoticed,

but I've got it all here in my heart.

I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it.

I would be nothing without you.



Did you ever know that you're my hero?

You're everything I wish I could be.

I could fly higher than an eagle,

Oh, the wind beneath my wings.

Fly, fly, fly away. You let me fly so high.

Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings.

"So lately, been wondering

Who will be there to take my place

When I'm gone you'll need love to light the shadows on your face

If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all

Then between the sand and stone, could you make it on your own

If I could, then I would,

I'll go wherever you will go

Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go



And maybe, I'll find out

A way to make it back someday

To watch you, to guide you, through the darkest of your days

If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all

Then I hope there's someone out there

Who can bring me back to you



If I could, then I would,

I'll go wherever you will go

Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go



Run away with my heart

Run away with my hope

Run away with my love



I know now, just quite how, 

My life and love may still go on

In your heart, in your mind, I'll stay with you for all of time



If I could, then I would,

I'll go wherever you will go

Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go



If I could turn back time

I'll go wherever you will go

If I could make you mine

I'll go wherever you will go

I'll go wherever you will go"

Pennies and dimes for a kiss

I wasn't looking for this,

Ripped jeans, skin was showin'

Why does the sea rush to shore.

Don't they know, it's the end of the world,

It ended when I lost your love.



I wake up in the morning and I wonder.

Why everything's the same as it was.

I can't understand, no I can't understand,

How life goes on the way it does.



Why does my heart go on beating,

Why do these eyes of mine cry.

Don't they know, it's the end of the world,

Maybe I'll forgive you, hmm 

Maybe you'll try 

We should be happy together 

Forever, you and I 

Can you love me again like you loved me before 

This time I want you to love me much more 

This time instead just come to my bed 

And baby just don't let me, don't let me down 



Although we've come to the End Of The Road 

Still I can't let you go 

It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you 

Come to the End of the Road 

Still I can't let you go 

It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you 



Girl I'm here for you 

All those times of night when you just hurt me 

And just run out with that other fella 

Baby I knew about it, I just didn't care 

You just don't understand how much I love you do you? 

I'm here for you 

I'm not out to go out and cheat on you all night 

Just like you did baby but that's all right 

Hey, I love you anyway 

And I'm still gonna be here for you 'till my dying day baby 

Right now, I'm just in so much pain baby 

Coz you just won't come back to me 

Will you? Just come back to me 

(Lonely) 

Yes baby my heart is lonely 

(Lonely) 

My heart hurts baby 

(Lonely) 

Yes I feel pain too 

Baby please 

This time instead just come to my bed 

And baby just don't let me go 



Although we've come to the End Of The Road 

Still I can't let you go 

It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you 

Come to the End of the Road 

Still I can't let you go 

It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you 



Although we've come to the End Of The Road 

Still I can't let you go 

It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you 

Come to the End of the Road 

Still I can't let you go 

It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you"
"Schroeder - Wally Gold)

It's now or never,

come hold me tight

Kiss me my darling,

be mine tonight

Tomorrow will be too late,

it's now or never

My love won't wait.



When I first saw you

with your smile so tender

My heart was captured,

my soul surrendered

I'd spend a lifetime

waiting for the right time

Now that your near

the time is here at last.



It's now or never,

come hold me tight

Kiss me my darling,

be mine tonight

Tomorrow will be too late,

it's now or never

My love won't wait.



Just like a willow,

we would cry an ocean

If we lost true love

and sweet devotion

Your lips excite me,

let your arms invite me

For who knows when

we'll meet again this way



It's now or never,

come hold me tight

Kiss me my darling,

be mine tonight

Tomorrow will be too late,

it's now or never

My love won't wait."
"Would you know my name

if I saw you in heaven?

Would it be the same

If I saw you in heaven?

I must be strong

Would you hold my hand

If I saw you in heaven?

Would you help me stand

If I saw you in heaven?



I'll find my way 

through night and day.

'Cause I know I just can't stay 

here in heaven.



Time can bring you down

Time can bend your knees.

Time can break your heart

Have you begging please.

Begging please...



Beyond the door 

there's peace, I'm sure.

And I know there'll be no more 

tears in heaven.

"No clouds in my stones

Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank

Coming down with the Dow Jones

When the clouds come, we gone

We Roc-A-Fella

We fly higher than weather

And G5's are better

You know me

In anticipation for precipitation

Stack chips for the rainy day

JayRain Man is back

With little Ms. Sunshine

Rihanna, where you at?



You have my heart

And we'll never be worlds apart

May be in magazines

But you'll still be my star

Baby, cause in the dark

You can't see shiny cars

And that's when you need me there

With you I'll always share

Because



When the sun shine, we shine together

Told you I'll be here forever

Said I'll always be your friend

Took an oath, I'mma stick it out to the end

Now that it's raining more than ever

Know that we'll still have each other

You can stand under my umbrella

You can stand under my umbrella

(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)

Under my umbrella

(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)



These fancy things

Will never come in between

You're part of my entity

Here for infinity

When the war has took its part

When the world has dealt its cards

If the hand is hard

Together we'll mend your heart

Because



When the sun shine, we shine together

Told you I'll be here forever

Said I'll always be your friend

Took an oath, I'mma stick it out to the end

Now that it's raining more than ever

Know that we'll still have each other

You can stand under my umbrella

You can stand under my umbrella

(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)

Under my umbrella

(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)



You can run into my arms

It's okay; don't be alarmed

Come into me

There's no distance in between our love

So go on and let the rain pour

I'll be all you need and more

Because



When the sun shine, we shine together

Told you I'll be here forever

Said I'll always be your friend

Took an oath, I'mma stick it out to the end

Now that it's raining more than ever

Know that we'll still have each other

"For all the times that you rained on my parade

And all the clubs you get in using my name

You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake!

You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song

'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

I don't but, you still hit my phone up

And baby I'll be movin' on

And I think it should be somethin'

That I don't wanna hold back

Maybe you should know that



My mama don't like you and she likes everyone

And I never like to admit that I was wrong

And I've been so caught up in my job,

Didn't see what's going on

But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself



But when you told me that you hated my friends

The only problem was with you and not them

And every time you told me my opinion was wrong

And tried to make me forget where I came from



And I didn't wanna write a song

'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

I don't but, you still hit my phone up

And baby I'll be movin' on

And I think it should be somethin'

That I don't wanna hold back

Maybe you should know that



My mama don't like you and she likes everyone

And I never like to admit that I was wrong

And I've been so caught up in my job

Didn't see what's going on

And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself



For all the times that you made me feel small

I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all

I never felt so low when I was vulnerable

Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself"
"When you're alone and life is making you lonely

You can always go - downtown

When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry

Seems to help, I know - downtown

Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city

Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty

How can you lose?



The lights are much brighter there

You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

So go downtown, things'll be great when you're

Downtown - no finer place, for sure

Downtown - everything's waiting for you



Don't hang around and let your problems surround you

There are movie shows - downtown

Maybe you know some little places to go to

Where they never close - downtown

Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova

You'll be dancing with him too before the night is over

Happy again



The lights are much brighter there

You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

So go downtown, where all the lights are bright

Downtown - waiting for you tonight

Downtown - you're gonna be all right now



And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you

Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to

Guide them along



So maybe I'll see you there

We can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares

So go downtown, things'll be great when you're

Downtown - don't wait a minute more

Downtown - everything's waiting for you



Downtown, downtown, downtown, downtown ..."
"When you called me up this morning,

Told me 'bout the new love you found,

I'm said \""I'm happy for you,

I'm really happy for you.\""

Found someone else,

I guess I won't be coming 'round.

I guess it's over, baby;

It's really over, baby, whoa...

And from what you said

I know you've gotten over me;

It'll never be the way it used to be.

So if it's gotta be this way,

Don't worry, baby, I can take the news okay.



[Chorus:]

But if you see me walking by,

And the tears are in my eyes,

Look away, baby, look away.

If we meet on the streets someday,

And I don't know what to say,

Look away, baby, look away.

Don't look at me;

I don't want you to see me this way.



When we both agreed as lovers,

We were better off as friends,

That's how it had to be,

Yeah, that's how it had to be.

I tell you I'm fine

But sometimes I just pretend;

Wish you were holding me,

Wish you were still holding me, whoa...

I just never thought,

That I would be replaced so soon;

I wasn't prepared to hear those words from you.

I know I wanted to be free;

Yeah, baby, this is how we wanted it to be.



[Chorus 2x]



When you called me up this morning,

Told me 'bout the new love you found.

I said \""I'm happy for you,

I'm really happy for you.\"""
"Sometimes, in our lives 
We all have pain, we all have sorrow 
But, if we are wise 
We know that there's always tomorrow 
Lean on me, when you're not strong 

And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on 

For, it won't be long 

Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on 



Please swallow your pride 

If I have things you need to borrow 

For no one can fill 

Those of your needs that you won't let show 



You just call on me brother when you need a hand 

We all need somebody to lean on 

I just might have a problem that you'll understand 

We all need somebody to lean on 



Lean on me, when you're not strong 

And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on 

For, it won't be long 

Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on 



You just call on me brother when you need a hand 

We all need somebody to lean on 

I just might have a problem that you'll understand 

We all need somebody to lean on 



If there is a load 

You have to bear, that you can't carry 

I'm right up the road 

I'll share your load if you just call me 

Call me if you need a friend 

Call me ..."
"Take a bow, the night is over

This masquerade is getting older

Light are low, the curtains down

There's no one here

[There's no one here, there's no one in the crowd]

Say your lines but do you feel them

Do you mean what you say when there's no one around [no one around]

Watching you, watching me, one lonely star

[One lonely star you don't know who you are]



Chorus:



I've always been in love with you [always with you]

I guess you've always known it's true [you know it's true]

You took my love for granted, why oh why

The show is over, say good-bye



Say good-bye [bye bye], say good-bye



Make them laugh, it comes so easy

When you get to the part

Where you're breaking my heart [breaking my heart]

Hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown

[Just make 'em smile the whole world loves a clown]

Wish you well, I cannot stay

You deserve an award for the role that you played [role that you played]

No more masquerade, you're one lonely star

[One lonely star and you don't know who you are]



(chorus, repeat)



Say good-bye [bye bye], say good-bye



All the world is a stage [world is a stage]

And everyone has their part [has their part]

But how was I to know which way the story'd go

How was I to know you'd break

[You'd break, you'd break, you'd break]

You'd break my heart



I've always been in love with you

[I've always been in love with you]

Guess you've always known

You took my love for granted, why oh why

The show is over, say good-bye



(chorus)



Say good-bye [bye bye], say good-bye

Say good-bye"
"Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?

Ooh heaven is a place on earth

They say in heaven love comes first

We'll make heaven a place on earth

Ooh heaven is a place on earth

When the night falls down

I wait for you

And you come around

And the world's alive

With the sound of kids

On the street outside



When you walk into the room

You pull me close and we start to move

And we're spinning with the stars above

And you lift me up in a wave of love...



Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?

Ooh heaven is a place on earth

They say in heaven love comes first

We'll make heaven a place on earth

Ooh heaven is a place on earth



When I feel alone

I reach for you

And you bring me home

When I'm lost at sea

I hear your voice

And it carries me



In this world we're just beginning

To understand the miracle of living

Baby I was afraid before

I'm not afraid anymore



Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?

Ooh heaven is a place on earth

They say in heaven love comes first

We'll make heaven a place on earth

Ooh heaven is a place on earth

"I can feel magic floating in the air

Being with you gets me that way

I watch the sunlight dance across your face

And I've never been this swept away

All my thoughts just seem 

To settle on the breeze

When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms

The whole world just fades away

The only thing I hear

Is the beating of your heart



And I can feel you breathe

It's washing over me

And suddenly I'm melting into you

There's nothing left to prove

Baby all we need is just to be

Caught up in the touch

A slow and steady rush

Baby isn't that the way 

That love's supposed to be

I can feel you breathe

Just breathe



In a way I know my heart is waking up

As all the walls come tumbling down

Closer than I've ever felt before

And I know and you know

There's no need for words right now



Cause I can feel you breathe

It's washing over me

And suddenly I'm melting into you

There's nothing left to prove

Baby all we need is just to be

Caught up in the touch

A slow and steady rush

And baby isn't that the way 

That love's supposed to be

I can feel you breathe

Just breathe



Caught up in the touch

A slow and steady rush

And baby isn't that the way 

That love's supposed to be

I can feel you breathe

Just breathe



I can feel the magic floating in the air

Being with you gets me that way"
"The first time ever I saw your face

I thought the sun rose in your eyes

And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave

To the dark and the endless skies, my love

To the dark and the endless skies

And the first time ever I kissed your mouth

I felt the earth move in my hand

Like the trembling heart of a captive bird

That was there at my command, my love

That was there at my command, my love



And the first time ever I lay with you

I felt your heart so close to mine

And I knew our joy would fill the earth

And last 'til the end of time, my love

And it would last 'til the end of time, my love



The first time ever I saw your face

Your face

Your face

Your face"
"Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is

I can only tell you what it feels like

And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe

I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight

As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight

High off her love, drunk from her hate

It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer

I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown

She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me, and I love it

Wait, where you going?, I'm leaving you

No, you ain't, come back!

We're running right back, here we go again

It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good, it's going great

I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane

But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed

I snap, Who's that dude?, I don't even know his name

I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again

I guess I don't know my own strength



Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie



You ever love somebody so much

You can barely breathe when you're with them?

You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit them

Got that warm fuzzy feeling

Yeah, them chills used to get them

Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at them?

You swore you'd never hit them, never do nothing to hurt them

Now you're in each other's face

Spewing venom in your words when you spit them

You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit them

Throw them down, pin them

So lost in the moments when you're in 'em

It's the rage that took over, it controls you both

So they say it's best to go your separate ways

Guess that they don't know you

'Cause today, that was yesterday

Yesterday is over, it's a different day

Sound like broken records playing over

But you promised her next time you'd show restraint

You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game

But you lied again

Now you get to watch her leave out the window

Guess that's why they call it window pane



Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie



Now, I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean

And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines

But your temper's just as bad as mine is

You're the same as me

When it comes to love, you're just as blinded

Baby, please come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me

Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems

Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano

All I know is I love you too much to walk away though

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk

Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?

Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball

Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall

Next time? There won't be no next time

I apologize even though I know it's lies

I'm tired of the games, I just want her back

I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fucking leave again

I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire



Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie"
"The first time ever I saw your face

"CHORUS :

Say you, say me; say it for always

That's the way it should be

Say you, say me; say it together

Naturally

I had a dream I had an awesome dream

People in the park playing games in the dark

And what they played was a masquerade

And from behind of walls of doubt a voice was crying out



CHORUS

As we go down life's lonesome highway

Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two

A helping hand - Some one who understands

That when you feel you've lost your way

You've got some one there to say \""I'll show you\""



CHORUS

So you think you know the answers - Oh no

'Couse the whole world has got you dancing

That's right - I'm telling you

It's time to start believing - Oh yes

Believing who you are: You are a shining star

"My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all

the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all

And even if I could it'd all be grey, but your picture on my wall

it reminds me that it's not so bad

it's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay

my head just feels in pain

I missed the bus and there'll be hell today

I'm late for work again

and even if I'm there, they'll all imply that I might not last the

day

and then you call me and it's not so bad

it's not so bad and



I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life

Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life



Push the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking through and

through

then you handed me a towel and all I see is you

and even if my house falls down now, I wouldn't have a clue

because you're near me and



I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life

Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life"
"Making my way downtown

Walking fast

Faces passed

And I'm home bound

Staring blankly ahead

Just making my way

Making my way

Through the crowd



And I need you

And I miss you

And now I wonder....



If I could fall

Into the sky

Do you think time

Would pass me by

'Cause you know I'd walk

A thousand miles

If I could 

Just see you

Tonight



It's always times like these

When I think of you

And I wonder

If you ever 

Think of me



'Cause everything's so wrong

And I don't belong

Living in your

Precious memories



'Cause I need you

And I miss you

And now I wonder....



If I could fall

Into the sky

Do you think time

Would pass me by

'Cause you know I'd walk

A thousand miles

If I could 

Just see you

Tonight



And I, I

Don't want to let you know

I, I

Drown in your memory

I, I

Don't want to let this go

I, I

Don't....

And I'm home bound



Staring blankly ahead

Just making my way

Making my way

And I still miss you

And now I wonder....



If I could fall

Into the sky

Do you think time

Would pass us by

'Cause you know I'd walk

A thousand miles

If I could 

Just see you...



If I could fall

Into the sky

Do you think time

Would pass me by

A thousand miles

Just hold you

"I can think of younger days 
when living for my life 
was everything a man could want to do. 
I could never see tomorrow, 
but I was never told about the sorrow. 


And how can you mend a broken heart? 

How can you stop the rain from falling down? 

How can you stop the sun from shining? 

What makes the world go round? 



How can you mend this broken man? 

How can a loser ever win? 

Please help me mend my broken heart 

and let me live again. 



I can still feel the breeze 

that rustles through the trees 

and misty memories of days gone by. 

We could never see tomorrow, 

no one said a word about the sorrow. 



And how can you mend a broken heart? 

How can you stop the rain from falling down? 

How can you stop the sun from shining? 

What makes the world go round? 



How can you mend this broken man? 

How can a loser ever win? 

Please help me mend my broken heart 

and let me live again."

We'll sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every da-a-y
We'll sing in the sunshine
Then I'll be on my way
I will never love you
The cost of love's too dear
But though I'll never love you
I'll stay with you one year
And we can sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every da-a-y
We'll sing in the sunshine
Then I'll be on my way
I'll sing to you each mornin'
I'll kiss you every night
But darlin', don't cling to me
I'll soon be out of sight
But we can sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every da-a-y
We'll sing in the sunshine
Then I'll be on my way
My daddy he once told me
\""Hey, don't you love you any man\""
\""Just take what they may give you\""
\""And give but what you can\""
\""And you can sing in the sunshine\""
\""You'll laugh every da-a-y\""
\""You'll sing in the sunshine\""

And I have gone away
You'll often speak about me
And this is what you'll say

Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.

Gimme that night fever, night fever.

We know how to show it.



Here I am,

praying for this moment to last,

living on the music so fine,

borne on the wind,

making it mine.



Night fever, night fever.

We know how to do it (oh).

Gimme that night fever, night fever.

We know how to show it.



In the heat of our love,

don't need no help for us to make it.

Gimme just enough to take us to the morning.



I got fire in my mind.

I get higher in my walking.

And I'm glowing in the dark,

I give you warning.



And the sweet city woman,

she moves through the light,

controlling my mind and my soul.



When you reach out for me, yeah,

and the feeling is bright.



Then I get night fever, night fever.

We know how to do it.

Gimme that night fever, night fever.

We know how to show it.



Here I am,

praying for this moment to last,

living on the music so fine,

borne on the wind,

making it mine.



Night fever, night fever.

We know how to do it.

Gimme that night fever, night fever.

We know how to show it.



Gimme that night fever, night fever.

We know how to do it.

Gimme that night fever, night fever.

We know how to show it.

Gimme that night fever, night fever.

We know how to do it...."
"Desperate for changing

Starving for truth

I'm closer to where I started

Chasing after you

I'm falling even more in love with you

Letting go of all I've held on to

I'm standing here until you make me move

I'm hangin by a moment here with you



Forgetting all I'm lacking

Completely incomplete

I'll take your invitation

You take all of me now



I'm falling even more in love with you

Letting go of all I've held on to

I'm standing here until you make me move

I'm hanging by a moment here with you

I'm living for the only thing I know

I'm running and not quite sure where to go

And I don't know what I'm diving in to

I'm hanging by a moment here with you



There's nothing else to lose

There's nothing else to find

There's nothing in the world

That could change my mind

There is nothing else...



Desperate for changing

Starving for truth

I'm closer to where I started

Chasing after you

I'm falling more in love with you

Letting go of all I've held on to

I'm standing here until you make me move

I'm hanging by a moment here with you"

Romantic talkin'? You don't even have to try

You're cute enough to fuck with me tonight

Lookin' at the table, all I see is weed and white

Baby, you livin' the life, but nigga, you ain't livin' right



Cocaine and drinkin' with your friends

You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend

I'm not phased, only here to sin

If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can



Call me when you want, call me when you need

Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way

Call me when you want, call me when you need

Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like



Hmm, hmm

Hmm, ah, hmm

Hmm, hmm, hmm

Ayy, ayy



I wanna sell what you're buyin'

I wanna feel on your ass in Hawaii

I want the jet lag from fuckin' and flyin'

Shoot a child in your mouth while I'm ridin'

Oh, oh, why me? A sign of the times, every time that I speak

A dime and a nine, it was mine every week

What a time, an incline god was shinin' on me

Now I can't leave

And now I'm actin' hella elite

Never walk with niggas that's in my league

I want to fuck the ones I envy, I envy



Cocaine and drinkin' with your friends

Money in the air as mo' fell

Grab you by your coattail, take you to the motel, ho sale

Don't tell, wont tell, baby say ?I don't talk, Dogg unless you told on me? - oh well

Shorty I can see you ain't lonely

Handful of n***** and they all got cheese

See you lookin' at me now what its gon' be

Just another tease far as I can see

Tryna get you up out this club if it means spendin' a couple dubs

Throwin' bout 30 stacks in the back make it rain like that cause I'm far from a scrub

And you know my pedigree, ex-deala use to move amphetamines

Girl I spend money like it don't mean nothing and besides I got a thing for you.



I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole,

I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know

I wanna fuck you, you already know

I wanna fuck you, you already know girl



Mobbin' through the club and I'm low pressin'

I'm sittin' in the back in the smoker's section (just smokin')

Birds eye, I got a clear view

You can't see me, but I can see you (baby I see you) -mm

It's cool, we jet, the mood is set, your p* is wet

You're rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck

Your body is movin', you humpin' and jumpin'

Your t****** is bouncin', you smilin' and grinnin' and lookin' at me



Girl and while your looking at me I'm ready to hit the caddy

Right up on the patio move the patty to the caddy

Baby you got a phatty, the type I like to marry

Wantin' to just give you everything and that's kinda scary

Cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass

Bouncin', got me tippin' my glass

normally don't get caught up too fast

But I got a thing for you



I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole,

I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know

I wanna fuck you, you already know

I wanna fuck you, you already know



I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole,

"No, you're never gonna get it (Ow!)

Never ever gonna get it (No, not this time)

No, you're never gonna get it (My love)

Never ever gonna get it

(repeat)

I remember how it used to be

You never was this nice, you can't fool me

Now you talkin' like you made a change

The more you talk, the more things sound the same

What makes you think you can just walk back into her life

Without a good fight? Oh...

I just sit back and watch you make a fool of yourself

Cuz you're just wasting your time, oh...



CHORUS

No, you're never gonna get it (Not this time)

Never ever gonna get it (My lovin')

No, you're never gonna get it (Had your chance to make a change)

Never ever gonna get it

(repeat)



Now you promise me the moon and stars

Save your breath, you won't get very far

Gave you many chances to make change

The only thing you changed was love to hate

It doesn't matter what you do or what you say

She doesn't love you, no way

Maybe next time you'll give your woman a little respect

So you won't be hearing her say, \""No way\""



CHORUS



Doesn't matter what you do or what you say

She don't love you, no way

Maybe next time you'll give your woman a little respect

So you won't be hearing her say, \""No way\""



[And now it's time for a breakdown...]



Never gonna get it, never gonna get it

Never gonna get it, never gonna get it

Never gonna get it, never gonna get it

Never gonna get it (whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)

Never gonna get it, never gonna get it

Never gonna get it, never gonna get it

Never gonna get it, never gonna get it

Never gonna get it, never get it



No, you're never gonna get it (Sweet lovin')

Never ever gonna get it (Sweet lovin')

No, you're never gonna get it (My lovin')

Never ever gonna get it (My lovin')

No, you're never gonna get it (Sweet lovin')

Never ever gonna get it (My lovin')

No, you're never gonna get it (Sweet lovin')

Never ever gonna get it (My lovin')...

"Imagine me and you, I do

I think about you day and night

It's only right

To think about the girl you love

And hold her tight

So happy together



If I should call you up

Invest a dime

And you say you belong to me

And ease my mind

Imagine how the world could be

So very fine

So happy together



I can't see me loving nobody but you

For all my life

When you're with me

Baby the skies will be blue

For all my life



Me and you

And you and me

No matter how they tossed the dice

It had to be

The only one for me is you

And you for me

So happy together



I can't see me loving nobody but you

For all my life

When you're with me

Baby the skies will be blue

For all my life



Me and you

And you and me

No matter how they tossed the dice

It had to be

The only one for me is you

And you for me

So happy together



Me and you

And you and me

No matter how they tossed the dice

It had to be

The only one for me is you

And you for me

So happy together

So happy together

How is the weather

So happy together

We're happy together

So happy together..."
"I can't get no satisfaction, I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no
When I'm drivin' in my car, and the man comes on the radio
He's tellin' me more and more about some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no. Oh, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey
That's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction, I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no
When I'm watchin' my TV and a man comes on and tells me
How white my shirts can be
But, he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I can't get no. Oh, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey
That's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction, I can't get no girl reaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no
When I'm ridin' round the world, and I'm doin' this and I'm signin' that
And I'm tryin' to make some girl, who tells me
Baby, better come back maybe next week
'Cause you see I'm on a losing streak
I can't get no. Oh, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey
That's what I say. I can't get no, I can't get no
I can't get no satisfaction, no satisfaction
No satisfaction, no satisfaction"
"Her hair is Harlow gold, her lips sweet surprise

Her hands are never cold, she's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll turn the music on you, you won't have to think twice

She's pure as New York snow, she got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you, she'll unease you

All the better just to please you

She's precocious, and she knows just

What it takes to make a pro blush

She got Greta Garbo's stand off sighs, she's got Bette Davis eyes



She'll let you take her home, it whets her appetite

She'll lay you on the throne, she got Bette Davis eyes

She'll take a tumble on you, roll you like you were dice

Until you come up blue, she's got Bette Davis eyes



She'll expose you, when she snows you

Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you

She's ferocious and she knows just

What it takes to make a pro blush

All the boys think she's a spy, she's got Bette Davis eyes



And she'll tease you, she'll unease you

All the better just to please you

She's precocious, and she knows just

What it takes to make a pro blush

All the boys think she's a spy, she's got Bette Davis eyes



And she'll tease you, she'll unease you

Just to please you, she's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll expose you, when she snows you

She knows you, she's got Bette Davis eyes"
"I don't know where I'm going

But, I sure know where I've been

Hanging on the promises

In songs of yesterday

An' I've made up my mind,

I ain't wasting no more time

But, here I go again

Here I go again



Tho' I keep searching for an answer,

I never seem to find what I'm looking for

Oh Lord, I pray

You give me strength to carry on,

'Cos I know what it means

To walk along the lonely street of dreams



An' here I go again on my own

Goin' down the only road I've ever known,

Like a drifter I was born to walk alone

An' I've made up my mind

I ain't wasting no more time



I'm just another heart in need of rescue,

Waiting on love's sweet charity

An' I'm gonna hold on

For the rest of my days,

'Cos I know what it means

To walk along the lonely street of dreams



An' here I go again on my own

Goin' down the only road I've ever known,

Like a hobo I was born to walk alone

An' I've made up my mind

I ain't wasting no more time



But, here I go again,

Here I go again,

Here I go again,

Here I go...



An' I've made up my mind,

I ain't wasting no more time



An' here I go again on my own

Goin' down the only road I've ever known,

Like a hobo I was born to walk alone

'Cos I know what it means

To walk along the lonely street of dreams



An' here I go again on my own

Goin' down the only road I've ever known,

Like a hobo I was born to walk alone

An' I've made up my mind

I ain't wasting no more time...

Here I go again,

Here I go again..."
"I'm not a perfect person

There's many things I wish I didn't do

But I continue learning

I never meant to do those things to you

And so I have to say before I go

That I just want you to know



I've found a reason for me

To change who I used to be

A reason to start over new

and the reason is you



I'm sorry that I hurt you

It's something I must live with everyday

And all the pain I put you through

I wish that I could take it all away

And be the one who catches all your tears

Thats why i need you to hear



I've found a reason for me

To change who I used to be

A reason to start over new



And the reason is you

And the reason is you

And the reason is you

And the reason is you



I'm not a perfect person

I never meant to do those things to you

And so I have to say before I go

That I just want you to know



I've found a reason for me

To change who I used to be

A reason to start over new

and the reason is you



I've found a reason to show

A side of me you didn't know

A reason for all that I do

And the reason is you"
"A lonely mother gazing out of the window

Staring at a son that she just can't touch

If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side

But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much

But all the praying just ain't helping at all

'Cause he can't seem to keep himself out of trouble

So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how

Another body laying cold in the gutter

Listen to me



Don't go chasing waterfalls

Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to

I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all

But I think you're moving too fast



Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation

But he just can't see

She gives him loving that his body can't handle

But all he can say is, \""Baby, it's good to me\""

One day, he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror

But he doesn't recognize his own face

His health is fading, and he doesn't know why

Three letters took him to his final resting place

Y'all don't hear me



Don't go chasing waterfalls

Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to

I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all

(Your way or no way)

But I think you're moving too fast

Don't go chasing waterfalls

Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to

I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all

But I think you're moving too fast



Come on!

I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms

Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray

Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray

All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days

And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo

The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew

Clear blue and unconditional skies

Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries

My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope

With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain

Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?

What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain

You claim the insane, and name this day in time

For falling prey to crime

I say the system's got you victim to your own mind

Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true

Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you



Don't go chasing waterfalls

Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to

I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all

But I think you're moving too fast

Don't go chasing waterfalls

Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to

I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all

But I think you're movin' too fast (Ooh, you're movin' too fast)

Don't go chasing waterfalls (Don't go, don't go)

Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to

I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all

(I know, I know, your way hey)

But I think you're moving too fast"

"Girl you know we belong together 
I have no time for you to be playing 
With my heart like this 
You'll be mine forever baby, you just see 
We belong together 

And you know that I'm right 

Why do you play with my heart, 

Why do you play with my mind? 

Said we'd be forever 

Said it'd never die 

How could you love me and leave me 

And never say good-bye? 

When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight

Maybe you'll try 

We should be happy together 

Forever, you and I

"As I walk this land with broken dreams

I have visions of many things

Love's happiness is just an illusion

Filled with sadness and confusion.

What becomes of the brokenhearted

Who had love that's now departed?

I know I've got to find

Some kind of peace of mind, maybe



The fruits of love grow all around

But for me they come a-tumblin' down.

Every day heartaches grow a little stronger

I can't stand this pain much longer



I walk in shadows searching for light

Cold and alone, no comfort in sight,

Hoping and praying for someone to care

Always moving and going nowhere



What becomes of the brokenhearted

Who had love that's now departed?

I know I've got to find

Some kind of peace of mind, maybe



I'm searching though I don't succeed,

But someone look, there's a growing need.

Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning,

All that's left is an unhappy ending.

Now what's become of the broken-hearted

Who had love that's now departed?

I know I've got to find

Some kind of peace of mind

I'll be searching everywhere

Just to find someone to care.

I'll be looking every day

I know I'm gonna find a way

Nothing's gonna stop me now

I will find a way somehow

"Hey Jude, don't make it bad.

Take a sad song and make it better.

Remember to let her into your heart,

Then you can start to make it better.

Hey Jude, don't be afraid.

You were made to go out and get her.

The minute you let her under your skin,

Then you begin to make it better.



And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,

Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.

For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool

By making his world a little colder.



Hey Jude, don't let me down.

You have found her, now go and get her.

Remember to let her into your heart,

Then you can start to make it better.



So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,

You're waiting for someone to perform with.

And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do,

The movement you need is on your shoulder.



Hey Jude, don't make it bad.

Take a sad song and make it better.

Remember to let her under your skin,

Then you'll begin to make it

Better better better better better better, oh.



Na na na nananana, nananana, hey Jude..."

"I wanna tell you all a story 'bout a Harper Valley widowed wife,

Who had a teenage daughter who attended Harper Valley Junior High,

Well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play,

And she said.\""Mom I got a note here from the Harper Valley PTA.\""

Well the note said, \""Mrs. Johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high.

It's reported you've been drinkin' and runnin' round with men and goin' wild.

And we don't believe you oughta be a bringin' up your little girl this way.\""

And it was signed by the secretary, \""Harper Valley PTA.\""



Well it happened that the PTA was gonna meet that very afternoon.

And they were sure surprised when Mrs. Johnson wore her mini-skirt into the room.

And as she walked up to the black board, I still recall the words she had to say.

She said I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA.



Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there, and seven tims he's asked me for a date.

And Mrs. Taylor seems to use a lotta ice, whenever he's away.

And Mr. Baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town?

And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep her window shades a pulled completely down.



Well Mr. Harper couldn't be here cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again.

And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin.

And then you have the nerve to tell me, you think that as a mother I'm not fit.

Well this is just a little Peyton Place, and you're all Harper Valley hypocrites.



No, I wouldn't put you on because, it really did happen just this way.

The day my momma socked it to, the Harper Valley PTA.

The day my momma socked it to, the Harper Valley PTA"

I knew I loved you before I met you

I think I dreamed you into life

I knew I loved you before I met you

I have been waiting all my life



There's just no rhyme or reason

only this sense of completion

and in your eyes

I see the missing pieces

I'm searching for

I know that it might sound more than

a little crazy but I believe



I knew I loved you before I met you

I think I dreamed you into life

I knew I loved you before I met you

I have been waiting all my life

I am complete now that I found you



I knew I loved you before I met you

There's been a load of compromisin'

On the road to my horizon

But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me



Like a rhinestone cowboy

Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

Like a rhinestone cowboy

Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know

And offers comin' over the phone



Well, I really don't mind the rain

And a smile can hide all the pain

But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way

And I dream of the things I'll do

With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe

There'll be a load of compromisin'

On the road to my horizon

But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me



Like a rhinestone cowboy

Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

Rhinestone cowboy

Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know

Fallin'

And cause me so much pain

I've taken more than would a fool

I start fallin' back in love with you



I keep on

"In a little while from now

If I'm not feeling any less sour

I promise myself to treat myself

And visit a nearby tower

And climbing to the top

Will throw myself off

In an effort to

Make it clear to whoever

Wants to know what it's like

When you're shattered

Left standing in the lurch at a church

Where people are saying, My God, that's tough

She stood him up

No point in us remaining

We may as well go home

As I did on my own

Alone again, naturally



To think that only yesterday

I was cheerful, bright and gay

Looking forward to who wouldn't do

The role I was about to play

But as if to knock me down

Reality came around

And without so much as a mere touch

Cut me into little pieces

Leaving me to doubt

Talk about, God in His mercy

Oh, if he really does exist

Why did he desert me

In my hour of need

I truly am indeed

Alone again, naturally



It seems to me that there are more hearts

Broken in the world that can't be mended

Left unattended

What do we do

What do we do



Alone again, naturally



Looking back over the years

And whatever else that appears

I remember I cried when my father died

Never wishing to hide the tears

And at sixty-five years old

My mother, God rest her soul

Couldn't understand why the only man

She had ever loved had been taken

Leaving her to start

With a heart so badly broken

Despite encouragement from me

No words were ever Spoken.

And when she passed away

I cried and cried all day

Alone again, naturally

Alone again, naturally"

"When you called me up this morning,

Told me 'bout the new love you found,

I'm said \""I'm happy for you,

I'm really happy for you.\""

Found someone else,

I guess I won't be coming 'round.

I guess it's over, baby;

It's really over, baby, whoa...

And from what you said

I know you've gotten over me;

It'll never be the way it used to be.

So if it's gotta be this way,

Don't worry, baby, I can take the news okay.



[Chorus:]

But if you see me walking by,

And the tears are in my eyes,

Look away, baby, look away.

If we meet on the streets someday,

And I don't know what to say,

Look away, baby, look away.

Don't look at me;

I don't want you to see me this way.



When we both agreed as lovers,

We were better off as friends,

That's how it had to be,

Yeah, that's how it had to be.

I tell you I'm fine

But sometimes I just pretend;

Wish you were holding me,

Wish you were still holding me, whoa...

I just never thought,

That I would be replaced so soon;

I wasn't prepared to hear those words from you.

I know I wanted to be free;

Yeah, baby, this is how we wanted it to be.



[Chorus 2x]



When you called me up this morning,

Told me 'bout the new love you found.

I said \""I'm happy for you,

I'm really happy for you.\"""

"I know this pain.

Why do lock yourself up in these chains?

No one can change your life except for you,

Don't ever let anyone step all over you.

Some day somebody's gonna make you want to

Turn around and say goodbye.

Hold on for one more day.



You could sustain,

Or are you comfortable with the pain?

You've got no one to blame for your unhappiness.

You got yourself into your own mess.

Lettin' your worries pass you by.

To change your mind?

"I've been in love so many times

Thought I knew the score

But now you've treated me so wrong

I can't take anymore

And it looks like

I'm never gonna fall in love again

Fall in love, I'm never gonna fall in love

I mean it

Fall in love again

All those things I heard about you

I thought they were only lies

But when I caught you in his arms

I just broke down and cried

And it looks like

I'm never gonna fall in love again

Fall in love, no, I'm never gonna fall in love

I mean it, I mean it

Fall in love again

I gave my heart so easily

I cast aside my pride

But when you fell for someone else, baby

I broke up all inside

And it looks like

I'm never gonna fall in love again

That's why I'm a-singin' it

Fall in love, no, I'm never gonna fall in love

Please don't make me

Fall in love again"

"Look into my eyes - you will see

What you mean to me

Search your heart - search your soul

And when you find me there you'll search no more

Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for

You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for

You know it's true

Everything I do - I do it for you



Look into your heart - you will find

There's nothin' there to hide

Take me as I am - take my life

I would give it all I would sacrifice

Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for

I can't help it there's nothin' I want more

Ya know it's true

Everything I do - I do it for you



There's no love - like your love

And no other - could give more love

There's nowhere - unless you're there

All the time - all the way



You can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for

I can't help it there's nothin' I want more

I would fight for you - I'd lie for you

Walk the wire for you - Ya I'd die for you



Ya know it's true

Everything I do - I do it for you"

Off to college

Yes you went away

Straight from high school

You up and left me

We were close friends

Also lovers 

Did everything 

For one another

I don't wanna let you know 

That it's killin' me

I know you got another life you gotta concentrate baby

Since you went away I

Don't really feel like talkin'

No one here to love me

Baby do you understand me

I can't do or be without you

"Risin' up

back on the street

did my time took my chances

went the distance

now i'm back on my feet

just a man and his will to survive

you must fight just to keep them alive

and he's watchin us all with the eye

hangin' tough

stayin' hungry

Run away but we're running in circles

I got a feeling it's time to let go

I said so,

I knew that this was doomed from the get-go

You thought that it was special, special

But it was just a sex doll, the sex doll

And I still hear the echoes, echoes

I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted

Nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention

I reckon it's again my turn 

to win some or learn some



I won't hesitate no more, no more

It cannot wait, I'm yours



Well open up your mind and see like me

Open up your plans and damn you're free

Look into your heart and you'll find love love love

Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing 

We're just one big family 

It's your God-forsaken right to be loved love love love loved



So I won't hesitate no more, no more 

It cannot wait I'm sure

There's no need to complicate 

Our time is short

This is our fate, I'm yours



I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror

And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer

But my breath fogged up the glass

And so I drew a new face and I laughed

I guess what I'm saying is there ain't no better reason

To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons

It's what we aim to do

Our name is our virtue



I won't hesitate no more, no more 

It cannot wait I'm sure

No need to complicate 

Our time is short

It can not wait, I'm yours



Well no no, well open up your mind and see like me

Open up your plans and damn you're free

Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love

Listen to the music of the moment come and dance with me

A la one big family (2nd time: A la happy family)

It's your God-forsaken right to be loved love love love



I won't hesitate no more

Oh no more no more no more

It's your God-forsaken right to be loved, I'm sure

There's no need to complicate

Our time is short

This is our fate, I'm yours



No I won't hesitate no more, no more

This cannot wait I'm yours

There's no need to complicate 

Our time is short

It's already coming in

Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind

You never could get it

Unless you were fed it

Now you're here and you don't know why



But under skinned knees and the skid marks

Past the places where you used to learn

You howl and listen

Listen and wait for the

Echoes of angels who won't return





Chorus

He's everything you want

He's everything you need

He's everything inside of you

That you wish you could be

He says all the right things

At exactly the right time

But he means nothing to you

And you don't know why



You're waiting for someone

To put you together

You're waiting for someone to push you away

There's always another wound to discover

There's always something more you wish he'd say



Chorus



But you'll just sit tight

And watch it unwind

It's only what you're asking for

And you'll be just fine

With all of your time

It's only what you're waiting for



Out of the island

Into the highway

Past the places where you might have turned

You never did notice

But you still hide away

The anger of angels who won't return



Chorus

I am everything you want

I am everything you need

I am everything inside of you

That you wish you could be

I say all the right things

At exactly the right time

But i mean nothing to you and i don't know why

And i don't know why

Why

I don't know"
"Baby you a song

You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Hey baby

When I first saw that bikini top on her

She's poppin' right out of the South Georgia water

Thought ol' good lord she had them long tanned legs

Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said



Baby you a song

You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle

Every little farm town with you

In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit

It'd look a hell lot better with you up in it

So baby you a song

You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise



She was sippin' on southern and singin' bars of tucker

We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer

She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said

Fire it up let's go get this thing stuck



Baby you a song

You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle

Every little farm town with you

In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit

It'd look a hell lot better with you up in it

So baby you a song

You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise



When that summer sun fell to its knees

I looked at her and she looked at me

And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night

Cause it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right



I put it in parking

Grabbed my guitar

And strummed a couple chords

And sang from the heart

Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'

Hell I can't get you out of my head



Baby you a song

You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle

Every little farm town with you



Baby you a song

You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle

Every little farm town with you

In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit

It'd look a hell lot better with you up in it

Come on



Baby you a song

You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Come on girl

Get those windows down and cruise

Aww yea"
"Can't you see I love you
Please don't break my heart in two
That's not hard to do
Cause I don't have a wooden heart
And if you say goodbye
Then I know that I would cry
Maybe I would die
Cause I don't have a wooden heart
There's no strings
Upon this love of mine
It was always you from the start
Treat me nice, treat me good
Treat me like you really should
Cause I'm not made of wood and
I don't have a wooden heart
Muss i denn, muss i denn
Zum Städtele 'naus
Städtele ?naus und
Du mein Schatz bleibst hier
Muss i denn, muss i denn
Zum Städtele 'naus
Städtele ?naus und
Du mein Schatz bleibst hier
There's no strings
Upon this love of mine
It was always you from the start
Sei mir gut, sei mir gut
Sei mir wie du wirklich sollst
Wie du wirklich sollst
Cause I don't have a wooden heart"

And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond

About the way things used to be

And if you walk right out my life

God knows I'd surely die

And I can't stop doin' without

Without the rythm of my heart

"Baby, don't understand

Why we can't just hold on to each others' hands?

This time might be the last, I fear

Unless I make it all too clear

I need you so, ohh

Take these broken wings

And learn to fly again

Learn to live so free

When we hear the voices sing

The book of love will open up and let us in

Take these broken wings



Baby, I think tonight

We can take what was wrong and make it right, mmm

Baby, it's all I know

That you're half of the flesh

And blood that makes me whole

I need you so



So take these broken wings

And learn to fly again

Learn to live so free

And when we hear the voices sing

The book of love will open up and let us in



Take these broken wings

You've got to learn to fly

Learn to live and love so free

And when we hear the voices sing

The book of love will open up and let us in, yeah, yeah



Let us in

Let us in



Baby, it's all I know

That you're half of the flesh

And blood that makes me whole

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah



So take these broken wings

And learn to fly again

Learn to live so free

And when we hear the voices sing

The book of love will open up and let us in



Take these broken wings

You've got to learn to fly

Learn to live and love so free

And when we hear the voices sing

The book of love will open up for us and let us in, yeah yeah

"You know the bed feels warmer

Sleeping here alone

You know I dream in colour

And do the things I want

You think you got the best of me

Think you had the last laugh

Bet you think that everything good is gone

Think you left me broken down

Think that I'd come running back

Baby you don't know me, cause you're dead wrong



What doesn't kill you makes you stronger

Stand a little taller

Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

What doesn't kill you makes a fighter

Footsteps even lighter

Doesn't mean I'm over 

cause you're gone



What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger

Just me, myself and I

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger

Stand a little taller

Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone



You heard that I was starting over with someone new

They told you I was moving on, over you



You didn't think that I'd come back

I'd come back swinging

You try to break me, but you see



What doesn't kill you makes you stronger

Stand a little taller

Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

What doesn't kill you makes a fighter

Footsteps even lighter

Doesn't mean I'm over 

cause you're gone



What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger

Just me, myself and I

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger

Stand a little taller

Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone



Thanks to you I got a new thing started

Thanks to you I'm not a broken hearted

Thanks to you I'm finally thinking bout me

You know in the end, 

the day you left was just my beginning

In the end...



What doesn't kill you makes you stronger

Stand a little taller

Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

What doesn't kill you makes a fighter

Footsteps even lighter

Doesn't mean I'm over 

cause you're gone



What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger

Just me, myself and I

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger

Stand a little taller

Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone



Not alone

"Nothing you could say 
Can tear me away from my guy

Nothing you could do 
Cause I'm stuck like glue to my guy

I'm stickin to my guy like a stamp to a letter

Like the birds of a feather 

We stick together..

I will tell you from the start

I can't be torn apart from my guy.



Nothing you can do

Could make me untrue to my guy

Nothing you could buy 

Could make me tell a lie to my guy...



I gave my guy my word of honor

To be faithful and I'm gonna

You best be believing

I won't be deceiving my guy...



As a matter of opinion I think he's tops..

My opinion is he's the cream of the crop

As a matter of taste to be exact

He's my ideal as a matter of fact..



No muscle bound man could take my hand from my guy

No handsome face could ever take the play of my guy

He may not be a movie star

But when it comes to be happy we are..

Theres not a man today 

who could take me away From my guy



No muscle bound man could take my hand from my guy

No handsome face could ever take the play of my guy

He may not be a movie star

But when it comes to be happy we are..

Theres not a man today 

who could take me away From my guy



Theres not a man today 

who could take me away From my guy"

"You walked into the party like you were walking onto a yacht

Your hat strategically dipped below one eye

Your scarf it was apricot

You had one eye on the mirror as you watched yourself gavotte

And all the girls dreamed that they'd be your partner

They'd be your partner, and...



You're so vain, you probably think this song is about you

You're so vain, I'll bet you think this song is about you

Don't you? Don't You?



You had me several years ago when I was still quite naive

Well you said that we made such a pretty pair

And that you would never leave

But you gave away the things you loved and one of them was me

I had some dreams, they were clouds in my coffee

Clouds in my coffee, and...



I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee

Clouds in my coffee, and...

Well I hear you went up to Saratoga and your horse naturally won

Then you flew your lear jet up to Nova Scotia

To see the total eclipse of the sun

Well you're where you should be all the time

And when you're not you're with

Some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend

Wife of a close friend, and..."
"Oh don't you dare look back

just keep your eyes on me.

I said your holding back,

She said shut up and dance with me!

This woman is my destiny

She said oh oh oh

Shut up and dance with me



We were victims of the night,

The chemical, physical, kryptonite

Helpless to the bass and faded light

Oh we were bound to get together,

bound to get together.



She took my arm,

I don't know how it happened.

We took the floor and she said



Oh don't you dare look back

just keep your eyes on me.

I said your holding back,

She said shut up and dance with me!

This woman is my destiny

She said oh oh oh

Shut up and dance with me



A backless dress and some beat up sneaks,

My disco tec Juliet teenage dream.

I felt it in my chest as she looked at me.

I knew we were bound to be together,

bound to be together



She took my arm,

I don't know how it happened.

We took the floor and she said



Oh don't you dare look back

just keep your eyes on me.

I said your holding back,

She said shut up and dance with me!

Shut up and dance with me



Deep in her eyes,

I think i see the future.

I realize this is my last chance.



She took my arm,

I don't know how it happened.

We took the floor and she said



Oh don't you dare look back

just keep your eyes on me.

Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me

Don’t pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me

You know how I like it when you lovin' on me

She say, \""Do you love me?\"" I tell her, \""Only partly\""

I only love my bed and my momma, I'm sorry

Fifty dub, I even got it tatted on me

And you know me

Turn the 02 into the 03, dog

Without 40, Oli', there'd be no me

Imagine if I never met the broskies



God's plan, God's plan

I can't do this on my own (ayy, no, ayy)

Someone watchin' this shit close (yep, close)

I've been me since Scarlett Road (ayy, road, ayy)

And please, say to me

You'll let me hold your hand.

open up the dirty window

let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find



reaching for something in the distance

so close you can almost taste it

release your innovations

feel the rain on your skin

no one else can feel it for you

only you can let it in

can speak the words on your lips

drench yourself in words unspoken

live your life with arms wide open

today is where your book begins

the rest is still unwritten

within condition, to not make mistakes, but i can't live that way

She hit the flo (She hit the flo)

Next thing you know

Shawty got low low low low low low low low



Them baggy sweat pants

And the Reeboks with the straps (With the straps)

She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (Ayy)

She hit the flo (She hit the flo)

Next thing you know

Shawty got low low low low low low low low



I ain't never seen nuthin that'll make me go,

This crazy all night spendin my dough

Had a million dollar vibe and a bottle to go

Dem birthday cakes, they stole the show

So sexual, she was flexible

Professional, drinkin X and ooo

Hold up wait a minute, do I see what I think I

Whoa

Did I think I seen shorty get low

Ain't the same when it's up that close

Make it rain, I'm makin it snow

Work the pole, I got the bank roll

I'm a say that I prefer them no clothes

I'm into that, I love women exposed

She threw it back at me, I gave her more

Cash ain't a problem, I know where it goes



She had them

Hey

Shawty what I gotta do to get you home

My jeans full of gwap

And they ready for Shones

Cadillacs Maybachs for the sexy grown

Patrone on the rocks that'll make you moan



One stack (come on)

Two stacks (come on)

Three stacks (come on, now that's three grand)

What you think I'm playin baby girl

I'm the man, I'll bend the rubber bands



That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder

I knew it was ova, that Henny and Cola

Got me like a Soldier

She ready for Rover, I couldn't control her

So lucky oo me, I was just like a clover

Shorty was hot like a toaster

Sorry but I had to fold her,

Like a pornography poster

She showed her

Whoa

Yea she was worth the money

Lil mama took my cash,

And I ain't want it back,

The way she bit that rag,

Got her them paper stacks,

Tatto above her crack,

I had to handle that,



I was on it, sexy woman, let me shownin

They be want it two in the mornin

I'm zonin in them rosay bottles foamin

She wouldn't stop, made it drop

Shorty did that pop and lock,

Had to break her off that gwap

Gah it was fly just like my glock

"Closed off from love

I didn't need the pain

Once or twice was enough

And it was all in vain

Time starts to pass

Before you know it you're frozen



But something happened

For the very first time with you

My heart melts into the ground

Found something true

And everyone's looking round

Thinking I'm going crazy



But I don't care what they say

I'm in love with you

They try to pull me away

But they don't know the truth

My heart's crippled by the vein

That I keep on closing

You cut me open and I



Keep bleeding

Keep, keep bleeding love

I keep bleeding

I keep, keep bleeding love

Keep bleeding

Keep, keep bleeding love

You cut me open



Trying hard not to hear

But they talk so loud

Their piercing sounds fill my ears

Try to fill me with doubt

Yet I know that the goal

Is to keep me from falling



But nothing's greater than the risk that comes with your embrace

And in this world of loneliness

I see your face

Yet everyone around me

Thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe



But I don't care what they say

I'm in love with you

They try to pull me away

But they don't know the truth

My heart's crippled by the vein

That I keep on closing

You cut me open and I



Keep bleeding

Keep, keep bleeding love

I keep bleeding

I keep, keep bleeding love

Keep bleeding

Keep, keep bleeding love

You cut me open



And it's draining all of me

Oh they find it hard to believe

I'll be wearing these scars

For everyone to see



I don't care what they say

I'm in love with you

They try to pull me away

But they don't know the truth

My heart's crippled by the vein

That I keep on closing

You cut me open and I



Keep bleeding

Keep, keep bleeding love

I keep bleeding

I keep, keep bleeding love

Keep bleeding

Keep, keep bleeding love

You cut me open and I



Keep bleeding

Keep, keep bleeding love

I keep bleeding

I keep, keep bleeding love

Keep bleeding

Keep, keep bleeding love

You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding

Keep, keep bleeding love"
"Saturday morning jumped out of bed

Knocked on your door

Standing at that alter

Or we will run away

To another galaxy you know

You know she's in love with me

She will go anywhere I go



Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life? Say yes, say yes

Cause I need to know

You say I'll never get your blessing till the day I die

Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now

Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now



Usually I put somethin' on TV

So we never think about you and me

But today I see our reflections clearly

In Hollywood, layin' on the screen

You just need a better life than this

You need somethin' I can never give

Fake water all across the road

It's gone now, the night has come, but



Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now



You can't fight it, you can't breathe

You say somethin' so lovin', but

Now I gotta let you go

You'll be better off in someone new

I don't wanna be alone

You know it hurts me too

You look so broken when you cry

One more and then I say goodbye



Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now

Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

Heat waves been fakin' me out

Can't make you happier now



I just wonder what you're dreamin' of

When you sleep and smile so comfortable

I just wish that I could give you that

That look that's perfectly un-sad

Sometimes all I think about is you

Late nights in the middle of June

"The club isn't the best place to find a lover so the bar is where I go

Me and my friends at the table doing shots

Drinking fast and then we talk slow

Come over and start up a conversation with just me 
And trust me I'll give it a chance now

Take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox

And then we start to dance and now I'm singing like



Girl, you know I want your love

Your love was handmade for somebody like me

Come on now, follow my lead

I may be crazy, don't mind me

Say, boy, let's not talk too much

Grab on my waist and put that body on me

Come on now, follow my lead

Come, come on now, follow my lead



I'm in love with the shape of you

We push and pull like a magnet do

Although my heart is falling too

I'm in love with your body

And last night you were in my room

And now my bedsheets smell like you

Every day discovering something brand new

I'm in love with your body (Ohiohiohiohi)

I'm in love with your body (Ohiohiohiohi)

I'm in love with your body (Ohiohiohiohi)

I'm in love with your body

Every day discovering something brand new

I'm in love with the shape of you



One week in we let the story begin, we're going out on our first date

You and me are thrifty so go all you can eat

Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour

And how your family is doing okay

Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat

Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singing like



Girl, you know I want your love

Your love was handmade for somebody like me

Come on now, follow my lead

I may be crazy, don't mind me

Say, boy, let's not talk too much

"Head under water

And they tell me... to breathe easy for a while

The breathing gets harder... even I know that

Made room for me but it's too soon to see

If I'm happy in your hands

I'm unusually... hard to hold on to

Blank stares at blank pages

No easy way to say this

You mean well, but you make this hard on me



I'm not gonna write you a love song

'Cause you asked for it

'Cause you need one, you see

I'm not gonna write you a love song

'Cause you tell me it's

Make or break in this

If you're on your way

I'm not gonna write you... to stay

If all you have is leaving I'm gonna need a better

Reason to write you... a love song today

Today, yeah



I learned the hard way

That they all say... things you want to hear

And my heavy heart... sinks deep down under you and

Your twisted words,

Your help just hurts

You are not what I thought you were

Hello... to high and dry

Convinced me to please you

Made me think that I need this too

I'm trying to let you hear me as I am



I'm not gonna write you a love song

'Cause you asked for it

'Cause you need one, you see

I'm not gonna write you a love song

'Cause you tell me it's

Make or break in this

If you're on your way

I'm not gonna write you to stay

If all you have is leaving I'm gonna need a better

Reason to write you... a love song today



Promise me... you'll leave the light on

To help me see... with daylight, my guide, gone

'Cause I believe there's a way... you can love me

Because I say

I won't write you a love song

'Cause you asked for it

'Cause you need one, you see

I'm not gonna write you a love song

'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this

Is that why you wanted a love song

'Cause you asked for it

'Cause you need one, you see



I'm not gonna write you a love song

'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this

If you're on your way

I'm not gonna write you... to stay

If your heart is nowhere in it

I don't want it for a minute

Babe, I'll walk the seven seas when I believe that

There's a reason to

Write you... a love song today

Today (yeah eh eh eh)"

My muñequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa

You're my reason for reason, the step in my groove

I would give my world to lift you up

I could change my life to better suit your mood

Because you're so smooth



And it's just like the ocean under the moon

It's the same as the emotion that I get from you

You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth

Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it



I'll tell you one thing

If you would leave it would be a crying shame

In every breath and every word

I hear your name calling me out

Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm from your radio

You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow

Turning you round and round



And if you say this life ain't good enough

I would give my world to lift you up

I could change my life to better suit your mood

Because you're so smooth



And it's just like the ocean under the moon

It's the same as the emotion that I get from you

You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth

Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

Let's don't forget about it (no oh no oh)

Let's don't forget about it (no no no oh)

Let's don't forget about it (hey no no oh)

"Tumble outta bed

And I stumble to the kitchen

Pour myself a cup of ambition

And yawn and stretch

And try to come to life

Jump in the shower

And the blood starts pumpin'

Out on the street

The traffic starts jumpin'

The folks like me on the job from 9 to 5



Workin' 9 to 5,

What a way to make a livin'

Barely gettin' by

It's all takin' and no givin'

They just use your mind

And they never give you credit

It's enough to drive you crazy

If you let it

9 to 5, for service and devotion

You would think that I

Would deserve a fat promotion

Want to move ahead

But the boss won't seem to let me

I swear sometimes that man is out to get me



They let you dream

Just to watch 'em shatter

You're just a step

On the boss-man's ladder

But you got dreams

He'll never take away

You're in the same boat

With a lotta your friends

Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in

'N' the tide's gonna turn

And it's all gonna roll your way



Workin' 9 to 5

What a way to make a livin'

Barely gettin' by

It's all takin' and no givin'

They just use your mind

And you never get the credit

It's enough to drive you crazy

If you let it

9 to 5, yeah

They got you where they want you

There's a better life

And you think about it, don't you

It's a rich man's game

No matter what they call it

And you spend your life

Puttin' money in his wallet



9 to 5, whoa

What a way to make a livin'

Barely gettin' by

It's all takin' and no givin'

They just use your mind

And they never give you credit

It's enough to drive you crazy

If you let it



9 to 5, yeah

They got you where they want you

There's a better life

And you dream about it, don't you

It's a rich man's game

No matter what they call it"
"Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now

Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same

When our friends talk about you all that it does is just tear me down

Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

And it all just sounds like uh, uh, uh

Hmmm too young, too dumb to realize

That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand

Should have gave you all my hours when I had the chance

Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance

Now my baby is dancing, but she's dancing with another man.



My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways

Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life

Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made

And that hurts me every time I close my eyes

It all just sounds like uh, uh, uh, uh



Too young, too dumb to realize

That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand

Should have gave all my hours when I had the chance

Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance

Now my baby is dancing, but she's dancing with another man.



Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong

Oh, I know I'm probably much too late

To try and apologize for my mistakes

But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hand

Give you all his hours when he has the chance

Take you to every party cause I remember how much you loved to dance

Do all the things I should have done when I was your man!

Do all the things I should have done when I was your man!"
"I know this pain.

Why do lock yourself up in these chains?

No one can change your life except for you,

Or are you comfortable with the pain?

You've got no one to blame for your unhappiness.

You got yourself into your own mess.

Lettin' your worries pass you by.

Don't you think it's worth your time,

To change your mind?



No No.

I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again

I said I appreciate that and would you please explain

About the fifty ways



She said why don't we both just sleep on it tonight

And I believe in the morning you'll begin to see the light

And then she kissed me and I realized she probably was right

There must be fifty ways to leave your lover

Fifty ways to leave your lover

Till the dawn

"You got me looking at that heaven in your eyes

I was chasing your direction, I was telling you no lies

And I was loving you when the words are said,

Baby, I lose my head

And in a world of people, there's only you and I

There ain't nothing come between us in the end

How can I hold you when you ain't even mine?

Only you can see me through, I leave it up to you



Do it light, taking me through the night

Shadow dancing, baby you do it right

Give me more, drag me across the floor

Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more



All that I need is just one moment in your arms

I was chasing your affection, I was doing you no harm

And I was loving you, make it shine, make it rain,

Baby, I know my way

I need that sweet sensation of living in your love

I can't breath when you're away, it pulls me down

You are the question and the answer am I

Only you can see me through, I leave it up to you



CHORUS



And in this world of people, there's only you and I

There ain't nothing come between us in the end

Ah, can I hold you when you ain't even mine?

Only you can see me through, I leave it up to you

Holdin' me back

Gravity's holdin' me back

And everything gets in the way

Seems you cannot be replaced

And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh

In this world, it's just us

You know it's not the same as it was

"Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air

If I should die before I wake

It's 'cause you took my breath away

Losing you is like living in a world with no air

Oh



I'm here alone, didn't wanna leave

My heart won't move, it's incomplete

Wish there was a way that I can make you understand



But how do you expect me

to live alone with just me

'Cause my world revolves around you

It's so hard for me to breathe



Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air

Can't live, can't breathe with no air

It's how I feel whenever you ain't there

It's no air, no air

Got me out here in the water so deep

Tell me how you gonna be without me

If you ain't here, I just can't breathe

It's no air, no air



No air, air

No air, air

No air, air

No air, air



I walked, I ran, I jumped, I flew

Right off the ground to float to you

There's no gravity to hold me down for real



But somehow I'm still alive inside

You took my breath, but I survived

I don't know how, but I don't even care



So how do you expect me

to live alone with just me

'Cause my world revolves around you

It's so hard for me to breathe



Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air

Can't live, can't breathe with no air

It's how I feel whenever you ain't there

It's no air, no air

Got me out here in the water so deep

Tell me how you gonna be without me

If you ain't here, I just can't breathe

It's no air, no air



No air, air

No air, air

No air, air

No air, air

No more

It's no air, no air



Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air

Can't live, can't breathe with no air

It's how I feel whenever you ain't there

It's no air, no air

Got me out here in the water so deep

Tell me how you gonna be without me

If you ain't here, I just can't breathe

It's no air, no air



Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air

Can't live, can't breathe with no air

It's how I feel whenever you ain't there

It's no air, no air

Got me out here in the water so deep

Tell me how you gonna be without me

If you ain't here, I just can't breathe

"There's a summer place
Where it may rain or storm
Yet I'm safe and warm
For within that summer place
Your arms reach out to me
And my heart is free from all care

For it knows



There are no gloomy skies

When seen through the eyes

Of those who are blessed with love



And the sweet secret of

A summer place

Is that it's anywhere

When two people share

All their hopes

All their dreams

All their love



There's a summer place

Where it may rain or storm

Yet I'm safe and warm

In your arms, in your arms

In your arms, in your arms

In your arms, in your arms"

Her hands are never cold, she's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll turn the music on you, you won't have to think twice

She's pure as New York snow, she got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you, she'll unease you

All the better just to please you

She's precocious, and she knows just

What it takes to make a pro blush

She got Greta Garbo's stand off sighs, she's got Bette Davis eyes



She'll let you take her home, it whets her appetite

She'll lay you on the throne, she got Bette Davis eyes

She'll take a tumble on you, roll you like you were dice

Until you come up blue, she's got Bette Davis eyes



She'll expose you, when she snows you

Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you

She's ferocious and she knows just

What it takes to make a pro blush

All the boys think she's a spy, she's got Bette Davis eyes



And she'll tease you, she'll unease you

"There's a hero

If you look inside your heart 
You don't have to be afraid 
Of what you are 
There's an answer 
If you reach into your soul 

And the sorrow that you know 

Will melt away 



And then a hero comes along 

With the strength to carry on 

And you cast your fears aside 

And you know you can survive 

So when you feel like hope is gone 

Look inside you and be strong 

And you'll finally see the truth 

That a hero lies in you 



It's a long road 

When you face the world alone 

No one reaches out a hand 

For you to hold 

You can find love 

If you search within yourself 

And the emptiness you felt 

Will disappear 



And then a hero comes along 

With the strength to carry on 

And you cast your fears aside 

And you know you can survive 

So when you feel like hope is gone 

Look inside you and be strong 

And you'll finally see the truth 

That a hero lies in you 



Lord knows 

Dreams are hard to follow 

But don't let anyone

Tear them away 

Hold on 

There will be tomorrow 

In time 

You'll find the way



And then a hero comes along 

With the strength to carry on 

And you cast your fears aside 

And you know you can survive 

So when you feel like hope is gone 

Look inside you and be strong 

And you'll finally see the truth 

That a hero lies in you,that a hero lies in you....."

"Every breath you take

Every move you make

Every bond you break

Every step you take

I'll be watching you

Every single day

Every word you say

Every game you play

Every night you stay

I'll be watching you



Oh can't you see

You belong to me

How my poor heart aches

With every step you take



Every move you make

Every vow you break

Every smile you fake

Every claim you stake

I'll be watching you



Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace

I dream at night I can only see your face

I look around but it's you I can't replace

I feel so cold and I long for your embrace

I keep crying baby, baby please



Oh can't you see

You belong to me

How my poor heart aches

With every step you take



Every move you make

Every vow you break

Every smile you fake

Every claim you stake

I'll be watching you



Every move you make

Every step you take

I'll be watching you



I'll be watching you"
