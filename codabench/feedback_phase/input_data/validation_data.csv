"I've been walkin' these streets so long

Singin' the same old song

I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway

Where hustle's the name of the game

And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain

There's been a load of compromisin'

On the road to my horizon

But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me



Like a rhinestone cowboy

Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

Like a rhinestone cowboy

Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know

And offers comin' over the phone



Well, I really don't mind the rain

And a smile can hide all the pain

But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way

And I dream of the things I'll do

With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe

There'll be a load of compromisin'

On the road to my horizon

But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me



Like a rhinestone cowboy

Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

Rhinestone cowboy

Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know

And offers comin' over the phone



Like a rhinestone cowboy

Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo



Like a rhinestone cowboy

Gettin' card and letters from people I don't even know"
"The sun goes down the stars come out

And all that counts is here and now

My universe will never be the same I'm glad you came

You cast a spell on me, spell on me 
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me

And I decided you look well on me, well on me

So lets go somewhere no one else can see you and me



Turn the lights out now

Now I'll take you by the hand

Hand you another drink, drink it if you can,

Can you spend a little time

Time is slipping away

Away from us so stay

Stay with me I can make make you glad you came



The sun goes down the stars come out

And all that counts is here and now

My universe will never be the same I'm glad you came



You cast a spell on me, spell on me 

You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me

And I decided you look well on me, well on me

So lets go somewhere no one else can see you and me



Turn the lights out now 

Now I'll take you by the hand

Hand you another drink, drink it if you can

Can you spend a little time

Away from us so stay

Stay with me I can make, make you glad you came



The sun goes down the stars come out 

And all that counts is here and now

My universe will never be the same I'm glad you came

I'm glad you came 

Oh so glad you came 

I'm glad you came 

I'm glad you came



The sun goes down the stars come out 

And all that counts is here and now 

My universe will never be the same I'm glad you came"
"All the old paintings on the tombs

They do the sand dance, dont you know

If they move too quick (oh whey oh)

They're falling down like a domino.

All the bazaar men by the Nile

They got their money on a bet

Gold crocodiles (oh whey oh)

They snap their teeth on your cigarette.



Foreign types with the hookah pipes say:

Ay oh whey oh, ay oh whey oh

Walk like an Egyptian.



The blonde waitresses take their trays

They spin around and they cross the floor

They've got the moves (oh whey oh)

They drop your drink, then they bring you more.



All the school kids so sick of books

They like the punk and the metal band

When the buzzer rings (oh whey oh)

They're walking like an Egyptian.



All the kids in the market place say:

Ay oh whey oh, ay oh whey oh

Walk like an Egyptian.



Slide your feet up the street, bend your back

Shift your arm, then you pull it back

Life is hard, you know (oh whey oh)

So strike a pose on a Cadillac.



If you want to find all the cops

They're hanging out in the donut shop

They sing and dance (oh whey oh)

Spin the clubs, cruise down the block.



All the Japanese with their yen

The party boys call the Kremlin

And the Chinese know (oh whey oh)

They walk the line like Egyptian.



All the cops in the donut shop say:

Ay oh whey oh, ay oh whey oh

Walk like an Egyptian

Walk like an Egyptian."
"Turnaround, 
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely and you're never coming round

Turnaround, 
Every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears

Turnaround, 
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by

Turnaround, 

Every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes

Turnaround bright eyes, 

Every now and then I fall apart

Turnaround bright eyes, 

Every now and then I fall apart



And I need you now tonight

And I need you more than ever

And if you only hold me tight

We'll be holding on forever

And we'll only be making it right

Cause we'll never be wrong together

We can take it to the end of the line

Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time

I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark

We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks

I really need you tonight

Forever's gonna start tonight

Forever's gonna start tonight



Once upon a time I was falling in love

But now I'm only falling apart

There's nothing I can do

A total eclipse of the heart



Once upon a time there was light in my life

But now there's only love in the dark

Nothing I can say

A total eclipse of the heart



Turnaround bright eyes, 

Every now and then I fall apart



Turnaround bright eyes, 

Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight

And I need you more than ever

And if you'll only hold me tight

We'll be holding on forever

And we'll only be making it right

Cause we'll never be wrong together

We can take it to the end of the line

Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time

I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark

We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks

I really need you tonight

Forever's gonna start tonight

Forever's gonna start tonight



Once upon a time I was falling in love

But now I'm only falling apart

Nothing I can say

A total eclipse of the heart

A total eclipse of the heart

A total eclipse of the heart"
"Memories
Light the corners of my mind
Misty watercolor memories
Of the way we were
Scattered pictures
Of the smiles we left behind

Smiles we gave to one another

For the way we were



Can it be that it was all so simple then

Or has time rewritten every line

If we had the chance to do it all again

Tell me - Would we? Could we?



Memories

May be beautiful and yet

So much memories

What's too painful to remember

Of the way we were



Can it be that it was all so simple then

Or has time rewritten every line

If we had the chance to do it all again

Tell me - Would we? Could we?



Memories

May be beautiful and yet

Much too painful to remember

We simply choose to forget



So it's the laughter

We will remember

Whenever we remember

The way we were

The way we were

The way we were

The way we were so much baby

I miss the way we were"

"I used to be a rolling stone

You know if the cause was right

I'd leave to find the answer on the road

I used to be a heart beating for someone

But the times have changed

The less I say the more my work gets done



`Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom

From the day that I was born I've waved the flag

Philadelphia freedom took me knee-high to a man

Yeah gave me peace of mind my daddy never had



Oh Philadelphia freedom shine on me, I love you

Shine a light through the eyes of the ones left behind

Shine a light shine a light

Shine a light won't you shine a light

Philadelphia freedom I love you, yes I do



If you choose to you can live your life alone

Some people choose the city

Some others choose the good old family home

I like living easy without family ties

Till the whippoorwill of freedom zapped me

Right between the eyes"
"She wore blue velvet 
Bluer than velvet was the night 
Softer than satin was the light 
From the stars 
She wore blue velvet 
Bluer than velvet were her eyes 

Warmer than May her tender sighs 

Love was ours 

Ours a love I held tightly 

Feeling the rapture grow 

Like a flame burning brightly 

But when she left, gone was the glow of 

Blue velvet 

But in my heart there'll always be 

Precious and warm, a memory 

Through the years 

And I still can see blue velvet 

Through my tears"

"As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left 
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long, that 
Even my mama thinks that my mind is gone 
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it 
Me be treated like a punk you know that's unheard of 

You better watch how you're talking, and where you're walking 

Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk 

I really hate to trip but i gotta loc 

As I Grow I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool 

I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like 

on my knees in the night, saying prayers in the streetlight. 

Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Keep spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Keep spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 



The getto situation, they got me facin' 

I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the stripes 

So I gotta be down with the hood team 

Too much television watching got me chasing dreams 

I'm an educated fool with money on my mind 

Got my tin in my hand and a gleam in my eye 

I'm a loc'd out gangsta set trippin' banger 

And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger, fool 

Death ain't nothing but a heartbeat away, 

I'm living life, do or die, what can I say 

I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24 

The way things are going I don't know 



Tell me why are we, so blind to see 

That the one's we hurt, are you and me

Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Power and the money, money and the power 

Minute after minute, hour after hour 

Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking 

What's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin' 

They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me 

If they can't undersstand it, how can they reach me 

I guess they can't, I guess they won't 

I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool 



Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise 

Spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise

"When you're alone and life is making you lonely

You can always go - downtown

When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry

Seems to help, I know - downtown

Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city

Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty

How can you lose?



The lights are much brighter there

You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

So go downtown, things'll be great when you're

Downtown - no finer place, for sure

Downtown - everything's waiting for you



Don't hang around and let your problems surround you

There are movie shows - downtown

Maybe you know some little places to go to

Where they never close - downtown

Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova

You'll be dancing with him too before the night is over

Happy again



The lights are much brighter there

You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

So go downtown, where all the lights are bright

Downtown - waiting for you tonight

Downtown - you're gonna be all right now



And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you

Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to

Guide them along



So maybe I'll see you there

We can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares

So go downtown, things'll be great when you're

Downtown - don't wait a minute more

Downtown - everything's waiting for you

I feel magic when I touch your dress 

Silk and satin, leather and lace 

Black panties with an angel's face 



I see magic in your eyes 

I hear the magic in your sighs 

Just when I think I'm gonna get away 

I hear those words that you always say

"Her hair is Harlow gold, her lips sweet surprise

Her hands are never cold, she's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll turn the music on you, you won't have to think twice

She's pure as New York snow, she got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you, she'll unease you

All the better just to please you

She's precocious, and she knows just

What it takes to make a pro blush

She got Greta Garbo's stand off sighs, she's got Bette Davis eyes



She'll let you take her home, it whets her appetite

She'll lay you on the throne, she got Bette Davis eyes

She'll take a tumble on you, roll you like you were dice

Until you come up blue, she's got Bette Davis eyes



She'll expose you, when she snows you

Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you

She's ferocious and she knows just

What it takes to make a pro blush

All the boys think she's a spy, she's got Bette Davis eyes



And she'll tease you, she'll unease you

All the better just to please you

She's precocious, and she knows just

What it takes to make a pro blush

All the boys think she's a spy, she's got Bette Davis eyes



And she'll tease you, she'll unease you

She'll expose you, when she snows you

She knows you, she's got Bette Davis eyes"

Get through the night without you?

If I had to live without you,

What kind of life would that be?

Oh, I

I need you in my arms, need you to hold,

If you ever leave,

baby you would take away everything good in my life, 



and tell me now

How do I live without you?

I want to know,

How do I breathe without you?

If you ever go,

How do I ever, ever survive?

How do I, how do I, oh how do I live? 



Without you,

There'd be no sun in my sky,

There would be no love in my life,

There'd be no world left for me.

And I,

Baby I don't know what I would do,

I'd be lost if I lost you,

If you ever leave,

Baby you would take away everything real in my life,

How do I live without you?

I want to know,

How do I breathe without you?

If you ever go,

"When I find myself in times of trouble

Mother Mary comes to me

Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

And in my hour of darkness

She is standing right in front of me

Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.



Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be,

Whisper words of wisdom, let it be!



And when the broken hearted people

Living in the world agree,

There will be an answer, let it be.



For though they may be parted there is

Still a chance that they will see

There will be an answer, let it be.



Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be,

Yeah there will be an answer, let it be !



Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be,

Whisper words of wisdom, let it be !





Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be,

Whisper words of wisdom, let it be !



And when the night is cloudy,

There is still a light that shines on me,

Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.



I wake up to the sound of music

Mother Mary comes to me

Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.



Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be,

Yeah there will be an answer, let it be !

There's no guy slicker than this young fly nigga

Nickel-nine nigga, floss you die quicker (uh-huh)

This fed time outta town pie flipper

Turn Cristal into a Crooked I sipper

Everbody want to be fast, see the cash

Fuck around they weak staff, get a heat rash

Anything in Bad Boy way we smash (we smash)

Hundred G stash, push a bulletproof E-Class (ehehe)

I'm through with bein a player and a baller

Just want me one bad bitch so I can spoil her

Mase wanna be the one you respect, even when you're vexed

Rock Versace silks over spilled brunette

Got green never seen so you suck my jewels

Clutch my uz', anything I touch I bruise

Puff make his own laws, nigga fuck your rules (that's right)

Goodfellas, you know you can't touch us dudes



{Puff} Don't push us, cause we're close to the, edge

{Verse Two: Mase}



Broken glass everywhere {glass shatters}

I'm that Goodfella fly guy, sometimes wiseguys

Spend time in H-A-W-A-I-I

(Mase can you please stop smoking lah lah?)

Puff why try? I'm a thug, I'ma die high

I be out in Jersey, puffin Hershey

Brothers ain't worthy to rock my derby

Though I'm never drugged, I'm the venom in the club, G

Though I know the thug be wantin to slug me (uh-huh)

Could it be I move as smoove as Bugsy? (yeah)

Or be at the bar with too much bubbly? (c'mon)

Yo I think it must be the girls want to lust me

Or is it simply the girls just love me

Brothers wanna: rock the Rolls, rock my clothes

Rock my ice, pull out Glocks, stop my life (uhh)

I'm like, \""Damn, how these niggaz got they trust?

Used to be my man, how you gonna plot on my wife?\""

Do you think you snake me, cause they hate me?

Or he got his Ph.D; Player Hater's Degree? (Ahaha!)

Simply a lot of men be wantin to hear me

We spend cheese, in the West Indies

Then come home to plenty cream Bentleys (ahehe)

You name it, I could claim it

Young, black, and famous, with money hangin out the anus

And when you need a hit, who you go and get? (who?)

Bet against us? (Not a sure bet)

We make hits that'll rearrange your whole set (that's right)

"I met a gin-soaked bar-room queen in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride
She had to heave me right across her shoulder
'Cause I just can't seem to drink you off my mind

It's the honky tonk women

Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues



I laid a divorcée in New York City

I had to put up some kind of a fight

The lady then she covered me in roses

She blew my nose and then she blew my mind



It's the honky tonk women

Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

undercover angel, answer to my prayer

you made me know that there's a love for me

out there, somewhere



heavenly surrender, sweet afterglow

given up my heart to you, now angel don't go

she said, go find the right one, love her and then

when you look into her eyes, you'll see me again

I was chasing your direction, I was telling you no lies

And I was loving you when the words are said,

Baby, I lose my head

And in a world of people, there's only you and I

How can I hold you when you ain't even mine?

Only you can see me through, I leave it up to you



Do it light, taking me through the night

Shadow dancing, baby you do it right

Give me more, drag me across the floor

Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more



All that I need is just one moment in your arms

I was chasing your affection, I was doing you no harm

And I was loving you, make it shine, make it rain,

Baby, I know my way

I need that sweet sensation of living in your love

I can't breath when you're away, it pulls me down

You are the question and the answer am I

Only you can see me through, I leave it up to you

need some time off from that emotion

time to pick my heart up off the floor

you mean every word you say

can't help but think of yesterday

Before this river becomes an ocean

before you throw my heart back on the floor

oh baby I reconsider my foolish notion

well I need someone to hold me

Yes I've gotta have faith

I've got to have faith

Cause I don't have a wooden heart
And if you say goodbye
Then I know that I would cry
Maybe I would die
Cause I don't have a wooden heart
There's no strings
Upon this love of mine
It was always you from the start
Treat me nice, treat me good
Treat me like you really should
Cause I'm not made of wood and
I don't have a wooden heart
Muss i denn, muss i denn
Zum Städtele 'naus
Städtele ?naus und
Du mein Schatz bleibst hier
Muss i denn, muss i denn
Zum Städtele 'naus
Städtele ?naus und
Du mein Schatz bleibst hier
There's no strings
Upon this love of mine
It was always you from the start
Sei mir gut, sei mir gut
Sei mir wie du wirklich sollst
Wie du wirklich sollst
Cause I don't have a wooden heart"

"We were good, we were gold

Kind of dream that can't be sold

We were right 'til we weren't

Built a home and watched it burn

Mmm, I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna lie

Started to cry, but then remembered I



I can buy myself flowers

Write my name in the sand

Talk to myself for hours

Say things you don't understand

I can take myself dancing

And I can hold my own hand

Yeah, I can love me better than you can



Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby



Paint my nails cherry red

Match the roses that you left

No remorse, no regret

I forget every word you said



Ooh, I didn't wanna leave, baby, I didn't wanna fight

Started to cry, but then remembered I



I can buy myself flowers

Write my name in sand

Talk to myself for hours, yeah

Say things you don't understand

I can hold my own hand

Yeah, I can love me better than you can



Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Can love me better, I can love me better, baby

Can love me better, ooh, I



I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna fight

Started to cry, but then remembered I



I can buy myself flowers (Uh-huh)

Tell me, baby, cause I need to know now, oh, because



My loneliness is killing me

"For all the times that you rained on my parade

And all the clubs you get in using my name

You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake!

You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song

'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

I don't but, you still hit my phone up

And baby I'll be movin' on

And I think it should be somethin'

That I don't wanna hold back

Maybe you should know that



My mama don't like you and she likes everyone

And I never like to admit that I was wrong

And I've been so caught up in my job,

Didn't see what's going on

But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself



But when you told me that you hated my friends

The only problem was with you and not them

And every time you told me my opinion was wrong

And tried to make me forget where I came from



And I didn't wanna write a song

'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

I don't but, you still hit my phone up

And baby I'll be movin' on

And I think it should be somethin'

That I don't wanna hold back

'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself



For all the times that you made me feel small

I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all

I never felt so low when I was vulnerable

Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself



'Cause if you like the way you look that much

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

You should go and love yourself"

"You'd think that people 
Would have had enough 
Of silly love songs

Some people wanna fill the world 
With silly love songs

I'd like to know 

'cause here I go again

I can't explain the feeling's plain to me; 

Can't you see?

Sometimes it doesn't come at all

It isn't silly, love isn't silly, 

Love isn't silly at all

How can I tell you about my loved one?"

"Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is

I can only tell you what it feels like

And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe

I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight

As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight

High off her love, drunk from her hate

It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer

I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown

She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me, and I love it

Wait, where you going?, I'm leaving you

No, you ain't, come back!

We're running right back, here we go again

It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good, it's going great

I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane

But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed

I snap, Who's that dude?, I don't even know his name

I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again

I guess I don't know my own strength



Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie



You ever love somebody so much

You can barely breathe when you're with them?

You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit them

Got that warm fuzzy feeling

Yeah, them chills used to get them

Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at them?

You swore you'd never hit them, never do nothing to hurt them

Now you're in each other's face

Spewing venom in your words when you spit them

You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit them

Throw them down, pin them

So lost in the moments when you're in 'em

It's the rage that took over, it controls you both

So they say it's best to go your separate ways

Guess that they don't know you

'Cause today, that was yesterday

Yesterday is over, it's a different day

Sound like broken records playing over

But you promised her next time you'd show restraint

You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game

But you lied again

Now you get to watch her leave out the window

Guess that's why they call it window pane



Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie



Now, I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean

And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines

But your temper's just as bad as mine is

You're the same as me

When it comes to love, you're just as blinded

Baby, please come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me

Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems

Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano

All I know is I love you too much to walk away though

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk

Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?

Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball

Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall

Next time? There won't be no next time

I apologize even though I know it's lies

I'm tired of the games, I just want her back

I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fucking leave again

I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire



Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie"
"Hello, it's me

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet

To go over everything

They say that time's supposed to heal ya

But I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be

When we were younger and free

I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet



There's such a difference between us

And a million miles



Hello from the other side

I must've called a thousand times 

To tell you I'm sorry

For everything that I've done

But when I call you never 

Seem to be home



Hello from the outside

At least I can say that I've tried 

To tell you I'm sorry

For breaking your heart

But it don't matter, it clearly 

Doesn't tear you apart anymore



Hello, how are you?

It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry 

I hope that you're well

Did you ever make it out of that town

Where nothing ever happened?



It's no secret

That the both of us 

Are running out of time



So hello from the other side (other side)

I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)

To tell you I'm sorry

For everything that I've done

But when I call you never 

Seem to be home



Hello from the outside (outside)

At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)

To tell you I'm sorry

For breaking your heart

But it don't matter, it clearly 

Doesn't tear you apart anymore



Ooooohh, anymore

Ooooohh, anymore

Anymore



Hello from the other side (other side)

I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)

To tell you I'm sorry

For everything that I've done

All the better just to please you

She's precocious, and she knows just

What it takes to make a pro blush

She got Greta Garbo's stand off sighs, she's got Bette Davis eyes



She'll let you take her home, it whets her appetite

She'll lay you on the throne, she got Bette Davis eyes

She'll take a tumble on you, roll you like you were dice

Until you come up blue, she's got Bette Davis eyes



She'll expose you, when she snows you

Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you

She's ferocious and she knows just

What it takes to make a pro blush

All the boys think she's a spy, she's got Bette Davis eyes

"You walked into the party like you were walking onto a yacht

Your hat strategically dipped below one eye

Your scarf it was apricot

You had one eye on the mirror as you watched yourself gavotte

And all the girls dreamed that they'd be your partner

They'd be your partner, and...



You're so vain, you probably think this song is about you

You're so vain, I'll bet you think this song is about you

Don't you? Don't You?



You had me several years ago when I was still quite naive

Well you said that we made such a pretty pair

And that you would never leave

But you gave away the things you loved and one of them was me

I had some dreams, they were clouds in my coffee

Clouds in my coffee, and...



I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee

Clouds in my coffee, and...

Well I hear you went up to Saratoga and your horse naturally won

Then you flew your lear jet up to Nova Scotia

To see the total eclipse of the sun

Well you're where you should be all the time

And when you're not you're with

Some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend

Wife of a close friend, and..."

"There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of 
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above 
Ooh I lose control, can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love

How will I know (Don't trust your feelings) 

How will I know 

How will I know (Love can be deceiving) 

How will I know 

How will I know if he really loves me 

I say a prayer with every heart beat 

I fall in love whenever we meet 

I'm asking you what you know about these things 

How will I know if he's thinking of me 

I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak) 

Falling in love is all bitter sweet 

This love is strong why do I feel weak



Oh, wake me, I'm shaking, wish I had you near me now 

Said there's no mistaking, what I feel is really love 



How will I know (Don't trust your feelings) 

How will I know 

How will I know (Love can be deceiving) 

How will I know 

How will I know if he really loves me 

I say a prayer with every heart beat 

I fall in love whenever we meet 

I'm asking you what you know about these things 

How will I know if he's thinking of me 

I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak) 

Falling in love is all bitter sweet 

This love is strong why do I feel weak



If he loves me, if he loves me not

If he loves me, if he loves me not

If he loves me, if he loves me not



How will I know (Don't trust your feelings) 

How will I know 

How will I know (Love can be deceiving) 

How will I know 

How will I know if he really loves me 

I say a prayer with every heart beat 

I fall in love whenever we meet 

I'm asking you what you know about these things 

How will I know if he's thinking of me

Falling in love is all bitter sweet 

This love is strong why do I feel weak"

Somehow I made it through

Didn't know how lost I was

Until I found you

I was beat incomplete

I'd been had, I was sad and blue

But you made me feel

Yeah, you made me feel

Shiny and new

Touched for the very first time

Like a virgin

Next to mine



Gonna give you all my love, boy

My fear is fading fast

Been saving it all for you

'Cause only love can last



You're so fine and you're mine

Make me strong, yeah you make me bold

Oh your love thawed out

Yeah, your love thawed out

What was scared and cold

Touched for the very first time

Like a virgin

When your heart beats 

Next to mine

"Right now he's probably slow dancing with a bleach blonde tramp,

and she's probably getting frisky...

right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink cause she can't shoot whiskey...

Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick, showing her how to shoot a combo...

And he don't know...



That I dug my key into the side of his pretty little suped up 4 wheel drive,

carved my name into his leather seats...

I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights,

slashed a hole in all 4 tires...



Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats.



Right now, she's probably up singing some

white-trash version of Shania karoke..

Right now, she's probably saying \""I'm drunk\""

and he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky,

Right now, he's probably dabbing on 3 dollars worth of that bathroom polo...

And he don't know...



That I dug my key into the side of his pretty little suped up 4 wheel drive,

carved my name into his leather seats,

I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights,

slashed a hole in all 4 tires...



Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats.



I might saved a little trouble for the next girl,

Cause the next time that he cheats...



Oh, you know it won't be on me!



Ohh... not on me...

Cause I dug my key into the side of his pretty little suped up 4 wheel drive,

carved my name into his leather seats...

"Ohhhh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh.

It must have been cold there in my shadow,

to never have sunlight on your face.

You were content to let me shine, that's your way.

You always walked a step behind.

So I was the one with all the glory,

while you were the one with all the strength.

A beautiful face without a name for so long.

A beautiful smile to hide the pain.



Did you ever know that you're my hero,

and everything I would like to be?

I can fly higher than an eagle,

for you are the wind beneath my wings.



It might have appeared to go unnoticed,

but I've got it all here in my heart.

I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it.

I would be nothing without you.



Did you ever know that you're my hero?

You're everything I wish I could be.

I could fly higher than an eagle,

for you are the wind beneath my wings.



Did I ever tell you you're my hero?

You're everything, everything I wish I could be.

Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle,

for you are the wind beneath my wings,

'cause you are the wind beneath my wings.



Oh, the wind beneath my wings.

You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings.

Fly, fly, fly away. You let me fly so high.

Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings.

Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings.



Fly, fly, fly high against the sky,

so high I almost touch the sky.

Thank you, thank you,

thank God for you, the wind beneath my wings"
"CHORUS :

Say you, say me; say it for always

That's the way it should be

Say you, say me; say it together

Naturally

I had a dream I had an awesome dream

People in the park playing games in the dark

And what they played was a masquerade

And from behind of walls of doubt a voice was crying out



CHORUS

As we go down life's lonesome highway

Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two

A helping hand - Some one who understands

That when you feel you've lost your way

You've got some one there to say \""I'll show you\""



CHORUS

So you think you know the answers - Oh no

'Couse the whole world has got you dancing

That's right - I'm telling you

It's time to start believing - Oh yes

Believing who you are: You are a shining star



CHORUS

Say it together... naturally"

"Last night we let the liquor talk

I can't remember everything we said but we said it all

You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met

But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet

No way it was our last night

I kiss your lips

Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips

Last bottle of Jack we split a fifth

Just talk about life goin' sip for sip

You, you know you love to fight

And I say shit I don't mean

But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me



I know that last night we let the liquor talk

I can't remember everything we said but we said it all

You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met

But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet

No way it was our last night

No way it was our last night



No way it was the last night that we break up

I see your tail lights in the dust

You call your momma, I call your bluff

In the middle of the night, pull it right back up

Yeah my, my friends say let her go

Your friends say what the hell

I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else



Oh baby, last night we let the liquor talk

I can't remember everything we said but we said it all

You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met

But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet



No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough

I can’t remember everything we said but we said too much

I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left

But baby, baby somethin’s tellin’ me this ain’t over yet

No way it was our last night

No way it was our last night



I know you said this time you really weren’t coming back again

But baby, baby somethin’s tellin’ me this ain’t over yet

No way it was our last night

No way it was our last night"

There's many things I wish I didn't do

But I continue learning

To change who I used to be

A reason to start over new

and the reason is you



I'm sorry that I hurt you

It's something I must live with everyday

And all the pain I put you through

I wish that I could take it all away

And be the one who catches all your tears

Thats why i need you to hear



I've found a reason for me

To change who I used to be

A reason to start over new



And the reason is you

And the reason is you

And the reason is you

I've found a reason to show

A side of me you didn't know

A reason for all that I do

"And I never thought I'd feel this way

And as far as I'm concerned

I'm glad I got the chance to say

That I do believe I love you

And if I should ever go away

The way we do today

And then if you can remember



Keep smilin', keep shinin'

Knowin' you can always count on me, for sure

That's what friends are for

For good times and bad times

I'll be on your side forever more

That's what friends are for



Well, you came and opened me

And now there's so much more I see

And so by the way I thank you



Whoa, and then for the times when we're apart

Well, then close your eyes and know

These words are comin' from my heart

And then if you can remember, oh



Keep smiling, keep shining

Knowing you can always count on me, for sure

That's what friends are for

In good times, in bad times

I'll be on your side forever more

Oh, that's what friends are for



Whoa...oh...oh...keep smilin', keep shinin'

His Eyes Looked Like Mine

Go On Dance On The Floor In The Round, Baby
