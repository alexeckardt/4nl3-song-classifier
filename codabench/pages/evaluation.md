# Evaluation

Upload a zip file containing a model.py file with a Model class. The evaluator will train your model with the 
training data and make predictions for the testing data. 

The scoring metric used is the [F-1 score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html).
