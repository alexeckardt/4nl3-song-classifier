# Submission Format
Submit a zip folder containing a file called `model.py` with a class called `Model`. Train the model in a class function `fit()` and predict using class function `predict()`. 

```python
class Model:
    def __init__(self):
        """ Initialize model
        """
        pass

    def fit(self, X, y):
        """ Train the model.

        Args:
            X: Array of strings
            y: Array of class labels
        """
        pass

    def predict(self, X):
        """ Predict labels.

        Args:
            X: Array of strings
        
        Returns:
            Array of predicted class labels
        """
        pass
```
