Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there, and seven tims he's asked me for a date.

And Mrs. Taylor seems to use a lotta ice, whenever he's away.

And Mr. Baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town?

And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep her window shades a pulled completely down.



Well Mr. Harper couldn't be here cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again.

And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin.

And then you have the nerve to tell me, you think that as a mother I'm not fit.

I'm sittin' in the back in the smoker's section (just smokin')

Birds eye, I got a clear view

You can't see me, but I can see you (baby I see you) -mm

It's cool, we jet, the mood is set, your p* is wet

You're rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck

Your body is movin', you humpin' and jumpin'

Your t****** is bouncin', you smilin' and grinnin' and lookin' at me



Girl and while your looking at me I'm ready to hit the caddy

Right up on the patio move the patty to the caddy

Baby you got a phatty, the type I like to marry

Wantin' to just give you everything and that's kinda scary

Cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass

Bouncin', got me tippin' my glass

normally don't get caught up too fast

But I got a thing for you



I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole,

I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know

I wanna fuck you, you already know

I wanna fuck you, you already know



I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole,

I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know

Grabbed my guitar

And strummed a couple chords

And sang from the heart

He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is

Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze

If you look inside your heart 
You don't have to be afraid 
Of what you are 
There's an answer 
If you reach into your soul 

And the sorrow that you know 

Will melt away 



And then a hero comes along 

With the strength to carry on 

And you cast your fears aside 

And you know you can survive 

So when you feel like hope is gone 

Look inside you and be strong 

And you'll finally see the truth 

That a hero lies in you 



It's a long road 

When you face the world alone 

No one reaches out a hand 

For you to hold 

You can find love 

If you search within yourself 

And the emptiness you felt 

Will disappear 



And then a hero comes along 

With the strength to carry on 

And you cast your fears aside 

And you know you can survive 

So when you feel like hope is gone 

Look inside you and be strong 

And you'll finally see the truth 

That a hero lies in you 



Lord knows 

Dreams are hard to follow 

But don't let anyone

Tear them away 

Hold on 

There will be tomorrow 

In time 

You'll find the way



And then a hero comes along 

With the strength to carry on 

And you cast your fears aside

To put you together

You're waiting for someone to push you away

There's always something more you wish he'd say

And watch it unwind

Who will be there to take my place

When I'm gone you'll need love to light the shadows on your face

If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all

Then between the sand and stone, could you make it on your own

If I could, then I would,

I'll go wherever you will go

Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go



And maybe, I'll find out

A way to make it back someday

To watch you, to guide you, through the darkest of your days

If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all

Then I hope there's someone out there

Who can bring me back to you



If I could, then I would,

I'll go wherever you will go

Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go



Run away with my heart

Run away with my hope

Run away with my love

Looking forward to who wouldn't do

The role I was about to play

But as if to knock me down

Reality came around

And without so much as a mere touch

Cut me into little pieces

Talk about, God in His mercy

Oh, if he really does exist

Why did he desert me

In my hour of need

I truly am indeed

Broken in the world that can't be mended

And whatever else that appears

Never wishing to hide the tears

And at sixty-five years old

Couldn't understand why the only man

And there he was this young boy

A stranger to my eyes



Strumming my pain with his fingers

Singing my life with his words

Killing me softly with his song

Killing me softly with his song

Telling my whole life with his words

Killing me softly with his song



I felt all flushed with fever

Embarassed by the crowd

I felt he found my letters

And read each one out loud

I prayed that he would finish

But he just kept right on



Strumming my pain with his fingers

Singing my life with his words

Killing me softly with his song

Killing me softly with his song

Telling my whole life with his words

Killing me softly with his song



He sang as if he knew me

In all my dark despair

And then he looked right through me

As if I wasn't there

And he just kept on singing

Singing clear and strong



Strumming my pain with his fingers

We've known each other since we were nine or ten

Together we've climbed hills and trees

Learned of love and A B C's

Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees.

Out of time......

You tried to teach me right from wrong

Too much wine and too much song

Wonder how I got along.

When you see them I'll be there.

You gave me love and helped me find the sun

And every time that I was down

You would always come around

And get my feet back on the ground.

I'm tired of magazines

Sayin' flat butts are the thing

She gotta pack much back

I like 'em round, and big

And when I'm throwin' a gig

I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal

Now here's my scandal

I wanna get you home

And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh

I ain't talkin' bout Playboy

'Cause silicone parts are made for toys

I want 'em real thick and juicy

So find that juicy double

Mix-a-Lot's in trouble

Beggin' for a piece of that bubble

So I'm lookin' at rock videos

Knock-kneeded bimbos walkin' like hoes

You can have them bimbos

I'll keep my women like Flo Jo

A word to the thick soul sistas, I wanna get with ya

I won't cuss or hit ya

But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *fuck*

Til the break of dawn

Baby got it goin' on

A lot of simps won't like this song

'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it

And I'd rather stay and play

'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong

And I'm down to get the friction on

So, ladies! {Yeah!} Ladies! {Yeah}

If you wanna role in my Mercedes {Yeah!}

Then turn around! Stick it out!

Even white boys got to shout

Baby got back!



Baby got back!

Yeah, baby ... when it comes to females, Cosmo ain't got nothin'

to do with my selection. 36-24-36? Ha ha, only if she's 5'3\"".



So your girlfriend rolls a Honda, playin' workout tapes by Fonda

But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda

My anaconda don't want none

Unless you've got buns, hun

You can do side bends or sit-ups,

But please don't lose that butt

Some brothers wanna play that \""hard\"" role

And tell you that the butt ain't gold

So they toss it and leave it

And I pull up quick to retrieve it

So Cosmo says you're fat

Well I ain't down with that!

'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'

And I'm thinkin' bout stickin'

To the beanpole dames in the magazines:

You ain't it, Miss Thing!

Give me a sista, I can't resist her

Red beans and rice didn't miss her

Some knucklehead tried to dis

'Cause his girls are on my list

He had game but he chose to hit 'em

And I pull up quick to get wit 'em

So ladies, if the butt is round,

And you want a triple X throw down,

Staring at a son that she just can't touch

If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side

But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much

But all the praying just ain't helping at all

'Cause he can't seem to keep himself out of trouble

So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how

Another body laying cold in the gutter

Listen to me



Don't go chasing waterfalls

Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to

I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all

Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation

But he just can't see

She gives him loving that his body can't handle

But all he can say is, \""Baby, it's good to me\""

One day, he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror

But he doesn't recognize his own face

His health is fading, and he doesn't know why

Three letters took him to his final resting place

Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray

Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray

All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days

And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo

The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew

Clear blue and unconditional skies

Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries

My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope

With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain

Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?

What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain

You claim the insane, and name this day in time

For falling prey to crime

I say the system's got you victim to your own mind

Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true

Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you

Found something true

Their piercing sounds fill my ears

Try to fill me with doubt

Yet I know that the goal

Is to keep me from falling

And in this world of loneliness

I see your face

Thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe

And maybe we found love right where we are



When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades

And the crowds don't remember my name

When my hands don't play the strings the same way

I know you will still love me the same

Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen

And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory

And I'm thinking about how



People fall in love in mysterious ways

And maybe it's all part of a plan

I'll just keep on making the same mistakes

Hoping that you'll understand



But baby now, take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud

And maybe we found love right where we are



So baby now, take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, oh darling

Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud

And baby we found love right where we are

I will not give you up this time

But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own

And in your eyes you're holding mine



Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms

Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song

When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath

But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight



Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know

She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home

I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets

To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love

Fighting against all odds

I know we'll be alright this time

Darling, just hold my hand

Be my girl, I'll be your man

I see my future in your eyes



Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
